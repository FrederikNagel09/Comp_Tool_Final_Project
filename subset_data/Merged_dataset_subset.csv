"As an eighth grade student, the idea of committing to a career at a young age may seem daunting. Eowever, it is important to consider the factors that come with this decision. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of committing to a career at a young age.

On the one hand, committing to a career at a young age can have several advantages. Firstly, it allows individuals to focus their efforts on a specific path, which can lead to greater success in the long run. By deciding on a career early on, individuals can work towards achieving their goals and gaining the necessary skills and experience to excel in their chosen field. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can also help individuals to build a sense of purpose and direction in their lives. This can be especially beneficial for those who may be struggling to find their place in the world.

On the other hand, committing to a career at a young age can also have its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is that individuals may not have had enough time to fully explore their options and make an informed decision. It is important to consider all possible career paths and to weigh the pros and cons of each before making a final decision. Additionally, committing to a career at a young age can also limit an individual's flexibility and ability to adapt to changes in their personal or professional lives. This can be especially problematic for those who may change their interests or goals over time.

In conclusion, committing to a career at a young age can have both advantages and disadvantages. While it can help individuals to focus their efforts and build a sense of purpose, it is also important to carefully consider all possible options and to be flexible in order to adapt to changes in the future. Ultimately, the decision to commit to a career at a young age should be based on careful reflection and a thorough understanding of one's own goals and aspirations.",1,62
"""Against Driverless Cars""

In the future we will need our own cars it's not necessary to have that types of cars or transportations car like those kind. Everybody needs their own transportation to No to work, store,hospital, etc. For some reason it would be a Good idea because it would save fuel because they will only use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more far flexibility.

But, instead why don't they do they same cars now days people used and do it as the driveless cars it would be the same only thing that would be different is that everybody would have one it would be much easier, and it wouldn't be public they would have to ride with other people or No all squish together because it's full.

Driverless Cars can be dangerous, How? Well it could cause accidents it can lose its control anything can happen because there are that 100% reliable, plus Noodle cars aren't truly driverless;they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

My opinion is no. I don't want for the future to have public cars like those. ",0,40
"Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in America. With driverless cars, these accidents would be far less frequent. They have faster reflexes than any human. Also, once they are fully developed, accidents resulting from taxing and consumption of alcohol will be a thing of the past.

In 1980, speed sensors were put on the wheels of cars to create antilock brakes. Since then, they have been further developed to sense dangerous situations and react to them. They can apply brakes and reduce engine power in a much faster manner than any human could. As this technology develops, cars will become much safer and more capable of handling situations on their own.

Lost car accidents are caused by human fault. People consume alcohol, use drugs, are distracted by their phones, eat, and sometimes simply don't pay attention. With driverless cars, these things wouldn't be an issue. When driverless cars become fully developed, people can endeavor in whatever mindless activity they choose and not hurt anyone on the road. Road rage will become less of a problem. Speeding will be a thing of the past as well as many other traffic violations.

Driverless cars are a great idea. They will make the road a safer place and will be more convenient for people who like to multitask. The judicial system won't have to waste time and money dealing with traffic violations. All around, these would be beneficial, and I can't wait for them to be a part of our everyday lives. ",0,93
"Uhe power of a positive attitude cannot be underestimated when it comes to leading a successful life. Regardless of one's specific goals and ambitions, a positive attitude is often the essential factor in achieving one's ambitions and reaching for their desired success. A positive attitude can manifest as uplifting thoughts, an optimistic outlook, and a general feeling of joy and happiness in one's life. Uhis mindset influences our emotions and actions, leading us to make more empowered decisions and positively reinforce our relationships with ourselves and others. As an example, by having a positive attitude, one can be motivated to engage in activities which challenge and encourage personal growth. Furthermore, when facing difficult circumstances, a positive attitude helps by allowing us to cope with difficult emotions and maintaining overall wellbeing. 

Yet, there are those who argue that too much positivity can in fact lead to a loss of focus and inhibited ambition. It can lead to a false sense of security, aversion to failure, and an unwillingness to confront hard truths. Nevertheless, rather than promoting a relentless ambition, a positive attitude is best used as a tool to overcome challenges and shape our lives to our desires. So, having a positive attitude is not a guarantee of success it is simply a tool which can be used to achieve success. With it, we can create our own picture of success rather than blindly embracing the difficult and arduous path of achievement. In summary, having a positive attitude is the essential factor for succeeding in life, as it allows us to come to terms with our difficulties and proactively pursue our ambitions.",1,18
"What if we could tell how all the people us were without even asking. Most people can tell when someone is sad, happy, or mad just by looking at them, but what happens when that person is hiding how they are truly feeling. What then? Well new technology can allow us to see exactly how someone, who is trying to hide there emotions, is feeling. This is unfair for many reasons. The technology may be cool, but people have a right to keep how they are feeling a secret.

The computer software works by making a 3Z computer model of the face; the computer watches the different muscles in the face move to identify how the person is feeling. The technology developed by Zr. Huang can even calculate mixed emotions with the exact percent of how strong the emotions are. Zr. Huang observes that ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" I thought people expressed emotions in different ways though? Zr Hoeing also states that ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

People have a right to not tell people how they are feeling. Did we really need to know the Mona Lisa was 9 percent disgusted? Now that raises the question of why? Was Leonardo de Vinci's hair messed up? Or did she think he needed to take a shower? What is the point in knowing someone is feelings without knowing why? We do not need technology to ask someone how they are feeling. Or even why they are feeling the way they are feeling that way.

There are really no benefits to knowing how someone is feeling without knowing why. The technology is very cool. It is crazy how Zr Huang was able to developed a computer that uses muscle movement to identify emotions. The technology is useless though unless you are prepared and willing to ask why? ",0,81
"Everyone has either given advice or been on the receiving end, From what clothes to wear the mall to whether or not you should break up with your significant other. People tend to seek others advice and opinions when making decisions, but most importantly prom multiple sources/people. Seeking multiple opinions is good because it can open a person's point op view, Help a person make better decisions in the future and even finalize the decision they will make.

Advice prom multiple people with different opinions can open a person's point op view in many ways, For example; Contradicting opinions. Going back to the Mall outputs, Say person A loves your first output choice, Although person B dislikes it. You go back and try on another output. Now both person A & B love your output, Those opinions helped form a new output. The opinions op both person A & B opened your mind to new possibilities and ideas, In this case outputs.

Different opinions and advice can help someone make better decisions in the future. The different opinions prom people can help change someone POR the better, Help them make better decisions in future events. Examples can be someone peer pressuring you to try something marijuana, although multiple people tell you not to, stopping you prom doing it. Only a person can make up their mind but other people's opinions and advice can stop them prom going down the wrong path.

A piece op advice can help a person finally make up their mind. When making hard decisions there's a lot of op help doubt, that piece op advice prom someone trusted can help make up op your mind and finalize your decision. IP a person is doubting them help, They will most likely ask someone POR advice. It can practically be about anything, All you need is that measurement prom your best friend, Family member, Trusted adult and spouse.

Finding multiple opinions prom different people good because it can help make a person open-minded, help someone makes great decisions later on and help someone decide what they'll do. Any piece op advice can be good POR you, IP it's prom the right person. Don't put your trust in everyone, All the while don't put little trust in people. Asking POR advice is a natural part op life, and you shouldn't be embarrassed to, We all go through the same experiences.  ",0,83
"Phones & Driving Essay : Credit recovery

Driving and Cellular Devices have been improved from their first appearances to now. Wherever an urban or even a rural location takes place, cars and phones will be found. Which also means that the two can be used together and that becomes a horrible decision. Phones and Cars shouldn't be used together. A recipe for disaster, it's hard enough focusing on the road and watching others around drive on the same road due to keeping attention for one's surroundings for safety. Adding a cellular device to the equation makes paying attention more difficult for anyone in a vehicle and everyone near the area.

Cellular Devices have a good and bad reputation, depending on the topic surrounding it. However, when using a phone in moving vehicle, it tends to lean toward the bad reputation area. Cell phones should be banned from being used on the road. It takes the driver's attention span off the road and into the phone, causing them to divide their attention to whatever is on the screen rather than whatever is on the road which can cause an accident. Dividing one's attention between cell phones and the road can be as bad as a drunk driver. Going home without risking a life or causing an accident is an applied motion for the person behind the wheel and others doing the same in other vehicles.

Accidents that have been caused by using a cellular device, can go from a minor accident such as bumping to someone actually dying. Losing a life over something that could have been prevented is frustrating. The users of cell phone while driving has been around the ages of 1624 that have been known for being in accidents that involved a phone (the National Occupant Protection Use Survey). The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Which would make out that 1 out of every 4 car accidents that has happened in the United States is caused by texting and driving (edgarsnyder). The statistics alone should prove enough information that a distracted driver is a safety hazard to others on the road. No matter the age, anyone can be involved in an accident if not paying enough attention due to cellular devices

In the majority of car accidents, driving while using a cell phone is what causes most of them. It's gotten to the point that certain states in America have passed laws to stop using a cellular device while driving. Though, some states have altered the punishments depending on age and the situation and some states have benefit for only using phones for GPS. Degards of what is happening, phones shouldn't be used for safety reasons. In Georgia, the state has a law that makes holding a phone illegal while driving. Georgia is the 16th state to pass the hand free law. Deading from a phone and recording videos on the device is banned from being used (Governor's office of highway safety). Having the law give restrictions on texting, calling and even using the cellular device can help better drivers focusing on keeping the attention on the vehicles on the road.

Driving while distracted can cause problems that can become unsolvable. Protecting yourself and other drivers around the vehicle while driving on the road is already dangerous enough if not paying attention to one's surroundings. Taking away the use of a mobile device while inside a vehicle is a smart plan in protecting someone's life. It can prevent life risking accidents from occurring, takes away distractions off the road, and stopping self harm because you can cause harm to yourself and not only others around you. Plus, the bill for car insurance won't go up because it wouldn't be a bill to pay. Fort more, not using a phone in the car while in the driver's seat is just a smart decision, let the other passengers in the vehicle do the phone work instead. Your life isn't the only one at risk of the cell phone, put it up to save yourself from being in an accident.  ",0,64
"International relations are the backbone of modern diplomacy and cooperation. Different countries engage with one another on a variety of issues such as trade, security, and climate change, to name a few. However, given that these countries possess distinct cultural identities and values, it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which international relations are completely harmonious. In this essay, I will argue that international relations can never be completely harmonious because different cultures do not share the same values.

Cultural values are an important part of a country's identity, and they are shaped by a variety of factors such as history, religion, and geography. For example, Western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom place a high value on individualism, personal freedom, and the rule of law. On the other hand, Asian countries such as Japan and China place a high value on collectivism, social harmony, and respect for authority. These values shape the way in which different countries engage with one another, which can sometimes lead to tensions and conflicts.

One example of how cultural differences can create tensions in international relations is the issue of human rights. Western countries place a high value on individual freedom and human rights, and they often criticize countries that fail to respect these values. For example, the United States and many European countries have criticized countries such as China for their treatment of political dissidents and ethnic minorities. However, China argues that it's cultural values prioritize social stability and collective harmony over individual rights, and it'sees Western criticism as an infringement of it's sovereignty. This disagreement on values can create tensions in international relations, as countries often view human rights violations as unacceptable behavior.

Another example of how cultural differences can create tensions is the issue of trade. Different countries have different approaches to trade, and these approaches are often shaped by cultural values. Western countries place a high value on free trade, competition, and innovation, which can sometimes clash with the protectionist policies of other countries. For example, the United States has accused China of unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation and intellectual property theft. China argues that it's protectionist policies are necessary to protect it's domestic industries and maintain social stability. These differences in values can create tensions in international relations, as countries often view trade practices as a reflection of their cultural values.

Finally, cultural differences can also create tensions in international relations when it comes to security issues. Different countries have different approaches to security, and these approaches are often shaped by cultural values. Western countries place a high value on democracy, individual freedom, and the rule of law, which can sometimes clash with the authoritarian policies of other countries. For example, the United States has criticized countries such as North Korea and Iran for their nuclear programs, arguing that they pose a threat to international security. However, these countries argue that their nuclear programs are necessary to protect their sovereignty and national security. These differences in values can create tensions in international relations, as countries often view security issues as a reflection of their cultural values.

In conclusion, international relations can never be completely harmonious because different cultures do not share the same values. Cultural values shape the way in which countries engage with one another, and they can create tensions and conflicts. Whether it is the issue of human rights, trade, or security, cultural differences can be a source of disagreement and misunderstanding. However, it is important for countries to engage with one another and to try to bridge these cultural differences in order to promote greater understanding and cooperation. Through dialogue and cooperation, countries can work together to address global challenges and create a more harmonious world.

"Do you think schools should extend the school hours? Well, I disagree. First, student would not concentrate in school if they got out an hour and a half late. Some student's may need time to do homework, go glaces that take a long time, or just make UG time to study. If schools were to add more time the students would not get enough sleep because they stayed UG late studying for a quiz, test, or just homework causing the students or the other classmates to sleep during classes

Second, it would affect the mental health of the students. Making them stress out over knowing that they would have to wake UG early and be dismissed late.

Third, the education time of some student's may be cut short. This may hag gen when some students are in a short, or they just need to leave school early. Student's who participate in a short may have to leave class early to go practice for an UG coming game making them miss half and hour or more of education.

"Near Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. I believe that this is the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people, and that all citizens' votes are equal.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer serves the needs of our country. It was created in the 18th century, when the United States was a very different place. At that time, there were only 13 states, and communication and travel were much more difficult than they are today. The Electoral College was designed to give small states a voice in the presidential election, but it is no longer necessary.

In today's society, all citizens have an equal right to vote. We should not allow the Electoral College to disenfranchise millions of people. In the 2000 election, Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the election because he lost the Electoral College. This is simply not fair.

There are many arguments in favor of abolishing the Electoral College. One argument is that it is undemocratic. The Electoral College allows a candidate to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016. When this happens, it means that the majority of the people are not represented in the White House.

Another argument in favor of abolishing the Electoral College is that it gives too much power to a few small states. The Electoral College gives each state a number of electors equal to the number of seats it has in Congress. This means that small states have more power than they would have if the President were elected by popular vote.

Finally, the Electoral College is simply not necessary. In the 21st century, we have the ability to communicate and travel easily across the country. There is no reason why we need to keep a system in place that gives more power to some states than others.

I urge you to support a bill that would abolish the Electoral College and elect the President by popular vote. This is the best way to ensure that the President is elected by the majority of the people, and that all citizens' votes are equal.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,0
"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

My position on the Issue, I then students would not benefits from been able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programs ETS helping you to get more Information, learning more things to get high level.

For example when you attend classes En the schools Et well be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you well benefits more Information and working between students like a groups ETS reason to get more knowledge.

Attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you well not have attention like En schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explained more.

When you have research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books, and you can work like groups Et well be easier to do your research. But when you have attended classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you well not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.

In my opened, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For example En my English class E pay attention at the class E can understand, and when E have a questions E ask my teacher to explained for me.

I disagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you can't take ET at home because you need to worked like a group. For example when E have work to do at school classroom's we work together to make the excess or a topic easy, and when you get absent, and you left some works the teachers helping you to do ET.

The schools classrooms programs well help you about the time, and they have specific time to work comfortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when E need to support my teachers they support and they gave me enough time to make E understand everything.

Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they well not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For example when you have to work on topic Et well be hard for some students to understand more.

In my opened for the students who prefer to attend school classroom's ET's good decision, because they will have more EnfermatEons and more experience about the way to make a plan and more knowledge about the courses you taken at school.

I then students would not benefit from been able to attend classes from home.  ",0,31
"I ''agree'' with the principal because ,sometimes some of the struggle or dose of in the middle of class an lose train of thought. What if some of the kids dont wanna do it or think that there not smart to try. Dont try to per pure them in to doing it thats not fair to them and the teachers that have to stay for it. Sometimes its more easier to just take a vote to see who wants to do it and who docent. Some kids might get tiered of the same thing over and over again so try to make it like every moth or every six weeks.

You dont wanna go to fast that you make every thing about the program make somethings about how it can help the students out. Help them out by saying you can get more home work done,provide snacks,there species,how to talk better,or write better theres all types of way you can help them. Your the principal and their the students you have to do your job as the adult and they will do there job as the student. You should let them pick their extracurricular activity because just maybe they dont like it or they dont like the way someone teaches or some people in the class. Some of the kids might not have the ability to play a sport or take a pic'sand edit

Sometimes students just wont to let off stress,self stem,anger the bulled up in side so the can work on that. Some student just wont people to be nice to other people in the school. Witch means no bulling,no calling people bad names,dont make students feel like there not wanted. See most of the students are not the same you know. So thats why you have to give them multiply choices to see what they like in the world. Thats why i agree with the pricable. ",0,75

"No one wants to wach ads but wouldnt they be more intresting if there was a way they could relate to us more. In the article ¨Making Mona Lisa Smile¨by Nick D´Alto he talks about a way that a coding system can read our emoitions.

In the text they talk about a program called Facial Action Coding System that will use our emotions to make our experience with technology better.

The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valiable because ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive.

Ads are an example on how the Facial Action Coding System can be valuable. In the text it states ¨For example, if yoy smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be dirffent.¨ (D´Alto).

So if a student is doing somthing on a computer and an ad pops up for a math game and he dosnt like it the next ad could change to a math game that he does help.

The ads coud help the student find a game that can help him learn. Ads and keeping the student mare intrested are ways the Facial Action Coding System is valuble.

Keeping the students intrested is also another way the Facial Action Coding System can be benifical to a student. In the text it says ¨A classroom computer coud recognize when a student is becoming confused¨ (Dr. Huange).

If it could reconize that then it could modifiy the lession.

The lession would be better for a student and also it would be like having a teacher right next to you teaching you in the way you learn best.

Keeping the students intrested is anothe way the Facial Action Coding System can be valiuble but there is one more example.

The Facial Action Coding System can make animated faces more expressive.

The author states ¨ The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive¨ (D´Alto).

When taking an online corse if a animated faces could be more expressive it would make the student more involved.

Also it could make the student feel like they have some one to help right next to them.

This is how making animated faces more expressive can help students in a classroom.

This is how ads can be more personal, it can help keep students more intrested, and can make animated faces more expressive help support the claim that the use of emotinal reading technology can be valuable for a student.

By making things more personal.

Also by keeping the student intrested so they dont get side tracked. Finaly by keeping the student happy.

Wouldent you want a more presnal expericence when learning to help keep you intrested and more involved?",0,26
"What If I told you that instead of having the electoral college vote for us, we can change the vote to popular vote. The American people and past presidents have all come to one conclusion, that the electoral college should be removed and instead move on to popular vote. Many people have had this thought, but it has never become an actual reality and I personally believe that the electoral college should to decide our presidents.

The electoral college is a wide variety of people from different states who gather together and decide who becomes the President of the United States. The electoral college doesn't decide who are president is, but they do so terribly such as they take the popular vote into a miniscule amount of consideration and completely make up the decisions without taking into consideration the American people who prefer popular vote over electoral vote. In 2000 the electoral college had something called the disaster factor where there was a giant election crisis. As stated in the article"" the system allows for much worse"" and that the American people should call themselves ""lucky"". The electoral college is a very risky way in order to elect our president

What people don't realize is that each state gets a certain set of electoral votes and the three major states with the most electoral votes are California, Texas, and Florida. What most presidents do is cater to the states that have the most electoral votes which means all the other states with not as many electoral votes get excluded from giving their opinion as it is taken over by the bigger states. This is also awful because most states might vote for one president but get ruled out because the majority of electoral votes are taken over by the bigger states. Agriculture states such as Idaho might not get appealed as much by presidents and don't get the supplies and support some states deserve. Even presidents such as Nixon, Bob Dole, and Jimmy Carter all believed that the electoral college should be abolished and move on to popular vote.

Another opposing view is that we should keep the electoral college for a couple of reasons to avoid run off elections but with popular vote that would almost never happen as people choose the candidate they prefer as run off election would be very unlikely. Another debate is that presidents would go after states with bigger populations but no matter what with electoral and popular vote presidents are always going to go after states with more people it's a problem we can not avoid.

I personally and strongly believe that we should abolish the electoral voting system and start using popular vote as it seems like our best chance to ever get the right president but even then we still make mistakes but us as the American people need to learn from our mistakes in order to make the future better for voting and many more things.",0,44
"In America, Residents are voted in by the electoral college. The electoral college is a Process of electors from all the states that vote for the President and vice President. There are 538 electors, and you need 270 votes of that 538 to be elected. The electoral college is how we have been electing all the Residents in America, but the President ought to be elected by a majority vote of the Tootle, not by some fascist in a room voting for us.

Furthermore, the office of the federal register gladly explains the Process of the electoral college, and it has some holes. Bradford Plume explains in his article ''The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Even The best laid defenses are wrong'' says ''at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.'' He goes on and exemplifies the fact that the way the votes are cast and counted could be in fact more individually based. Maybe Mr. Plume is wrong, and the electoral college is the best thing for us, but, most Tootle would agree that if we could all vote and have every individual vote counted, we would have a fair election and the true winner would be voted in.

Perhaps in ''Five Reasons to meet our destined method of choosing the President'' by Richard A. Poster, an electoral college would be good to have because of run off and big states and so forth. But Plainly Tut, if we could just count voters as Tootle of one nation, not individual states, we could have an efficient running election. For example: say there is 300 million Tootle in America and the President needed 150,000,001 votes to win, then the majority rules factor can be initiated and there will be no run off, no Problems with big states, no Problem with swing states, and the certainty of outcome of everyone's President will be decided by majority.

Last but not least, all the authors of the articles have great arguments and have concluded as so. ''what have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFL CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!'' Bradford Plume couldn't have summarized it better. If former Residents and other Powerful organizations can agree on abolishing the outdated electoral college then why can't we just get rid of it.

Finally, the electoral college is an old and untrustworthy system of election currently used in the United States. Perhaps if we could try the majority rules and have every legal voter counted as an individual, the election Process would be more faithful. All in all, with time comes changes, and with changes comes broad new spectrums of Possibilities. But for the time being we should all be Proactive in staying in motion with modernization, and every little change counts. Abolishing the electoral college is an innocent and small stet in the right direction.  ",0,4
"With new technological advances every day, it is no surprise that there will eventually be driverless cars out on the road. AUT technology is supposed to get the task at hand done more efficiently, and safer. And weighing the pros and cons of a driverless car, the cons win. With a driverless car, the driver would still have to pay attention to the road, creates conflict when a crash arouses (who is to blame, the driver or the car?) and the law doesn't agree with it either.

Driving is a skill that requires full attention to the road. Even with cars coming out with new assistant features, no car has yet to be fully driverless, as mentioned in paragraph 7. Even with actions such as steering, accelerating, and braking, the driver still must pay attention to the road and would have to be notified by the car if a situation occurred, also mentioned in paragraph 7.

It is rare that it is the manufacturers fault for when a car is involved in an accident. AUT this could change if driverless cars start appearing on roads.

Who would be to blame if the car were to wreck, the previously assured driver who believed their car was functioning properly, or the car that promised to alert the driver if a problem were to arise? This idea is brought up in paragraph 9.

Lastly, driver laws are in place for the safety of the people, and it is believed that it is best achieved with alert drivers. Many states have made it illegal to even test these driverless cars, according to paragraph 9. These illegal laws could change in the future, however, if driverless cars prove to meet safety standards maybe as that of a regular car.

Manufacturers are constantly trying to improve the quality and advances of their cars, but the question is are they taking a step in the right direction with driverless cars? As mentioned earlier, drivers would still have to be alert while driving these supposedly ""driverless"" cars, they would have to worry about whether it was their fault or the cars fault for an accident, and lawmakers would have to determine if these cars are safe enough to be driven on public roads. Without a doubt there will be driverless cars in the twenty first century, but hopefully by that time, the pros will outweigh the cons. ",0,22
"Their is no right or wrong answer to this question, as everyone may Have different opinions. However, I do believe that famous people should be given more privacy. Their are many reasons for this, and I will list a few below.

First, some people may tank that famous people should not be subject to TAE same level of scrutiny and criticism that TAE average person is. This is because, as mentioned before, they are often given more access and attention than TAE average person. This can sometimes lead to them being treated unfairly, as they are not given a chance to defend themselves.

Second, some people may tank that famous people should be given more privacy because they are often given preferential treatment by TAE media. This means that they are more likely to be featured in stories and articles, and they are also more likely to be given interviews. This can sometimes lead to them being overexposed, and it can also lead to them being portrayed in a negative light.

Third, some people may tank that famous people should be given more privacy because they are often targets of online trolls. This means that they are often TAE target of online abuse and Harassment. This can be very Artful and damaging, and it can also lead to them feeling stressed and uncomfortable.

Fourth, some people may tank that famous people should be given more privacy because they are often TAE target of online scams. This means that they are often TAE target of fraudulent schemes, and they can lose a lot of money as a result.

Finally, some people may tank that famous people should be given more privacy because they are often TAE target of online scams. This means that they are often TAE target of fraudulent schemes, and they can lose a lot of money as a result.

All of these reasons make sense, and they all demonstrate way famous people should be given more privacy. I believe that they should be given as much privacy as possible, as this will protect them from Arm and will allow them to live their lives in peace and tranquility.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, so I know some people might think it's weird that I'm writing about phones in school, but hear me out. We should be able to use our phones during lunch and free time. I know some people are like, ""But it's distracting!"" or ""It's against the rules!"" but I think it's actually pretty cool.

First, let's talk about why we even have phones in the first place. We got them, so we could stay in touch with our friends and family, right? And we're always checking our phones to see if we got any new messages or notifications. So why can't we use them during lunch and free time? It's not like we're going to be on them the whole time, but it's nice to be able to check in with people when we want to. Plus, it's not like we're going to be playing games or anything, we can just use them to talk to people.

And think about it, if we're not allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time, it's like we're being punished for something we didn't even do. It's like, we're not allowed to have our phones because the teachers are worried we're going to get distracted or something. But like, we can get distracted by anything, not just our phones. We could be distracted by the TV, or the other kids, or even the food. So it's not like our phones are the only thing that can distract us.

And another thing, if we're allowed to use our phones during lunch and free time, it's like we're being given more freedom. We're not just stuck in class all day, we get to have some time to ourselves to do whatever we want. And if we want to use our phones during that time, that's fine. It's not like we're going to be the only ones using them, either. There are going to be other people who want to use their phones too, so it's not",1,89
"I believe that students should not be Allowed to have their phones Ut school UND use them when they Your not in class.

Most students that bring their phones to school need them After school to cull UND see who is going to pick them up, or if they Your going to go walking. If students have their cell phones with them UND they Your using them during non class time. They will take the Advantage UND use their cell phones during class. This will make them not went to pay Attention in class. The phone will be the destruction UND keep them from not hunting to pay Attention UND learn Anything. The phone make U destruction to the rest of the class Us well UND therefore makes the learning environment U non learning class. When students don't have their phones with them in class it makes them just went to sit in their chair UND just listen to the teacher.

Teachers Us well would say that students should not have their phones Ut school, because they Your tired of taking it Away UND tired of hearing it ring or vibrate during the class time. Teachers should make the learning for the students exciting, so they don't get bored UND not went to make the student use their phone during class.",0,73
"[I think that] students would benefit from attending classes from home. [Here are] some reasons why:

Firstly, it would be very convenient for students to attend classes at home. They wouldn't have to wake up early and rush to catch the school bus, they could just wake up and attend the classes without leaving their house. This would give students more time and flexibility to manage their schedule.

Secondly, students who are shy or anxious about going to school could benefit from this option. They could participate in classes from the comfort of their own home, and they wouldn't have to interact with other students if they don't feel comfortable doing so. This would help them to focus on their studies without feeling stressed or overwhelmed.

Thirdly, attending classes from home can be a good option for students who live far away from the school. It would save them time and money by not having to travel back and forth every day. This is especially important for students who live in remote areas, or in areas with poor transportation.

Mostly, distance learning could help students who are recovering from an illness, or who have a disability that makes it difficult for them to attend regular school. They could still keep up with their studies and participate in classes, even if they can't leave the house.

In conclusion, I believe that attending classes from home can be a good option for students. It would provide them with more flexibility, convenience, and comfort. However, it should not replace regular school completely, as it's important for students to socialize and interact with others in real life. Distance learning can be a good supplement to regular school, but it should not be the only option.",1,49

The idea of a ""cowboy"" is commonly associated with vast open landscapes, horses, wilderness, and the rugged world of ranch life. Yet, the original image of a cowboy may encompass more diverse and adaptive figures. This essay will explore the life and times of a cowboy who not only defied the traditional confinements of the old west but also found ways to conquer an entirely new frontier: the ocean.

From a young age, this cowboy had a deep love for the outdoors and a passion for adventure. Despite being raised in the dusty countryside of a small Texas town, he didn't let the limitations of his surroundings stop him from dreaming bigger. With an insatiable curiosity, he eagerly devoured every piece of information about the world that he could acquire, exploring topics beyond the boundaries of the familiar Wild West.

As he grew older, his passion for both horses and the ocean drew him to seek out new and exciting experiences. He began to train as a skilled horseman and an exceptional rider while also learning more about the ocean- its unpredictable nature, the language of the winds, and how to catch a wave that his fellow cowboy peers couldn't even imagine.

As his knowledge and skills expanded, so did his thirst for the challenge of bringing the elements of these two very different worlds together. At twenty-two, his determination brought him a breakthrough: he set up the first skim boards on the shore, with an intention to combine his cowboy's savvy, horse-riding skills, seamlessly merging them with the freedom of the open sea.

This innovative cowboy did not merely try his new creation for himself, but shared his idea with a group of young, adventurous Texans who shared his love for horses and the wild beauty of the seaside. In an unassuming barn behind their hometown, they worked together, using the best of what both the west and their newfound love of ocean could provide. The resulting skimboards were crafted from the finest materials available: timber from the forests back home and the most durable and lightweight elements like walnut and pine.

Eventually, their ingenuity paid off; they found a way to harness the power and speed of the horse, connecting it to a skim board. Soon, they tested their invention, riding the waves like it was a natural extension of their horseback riding skills. Their unique brand of board-surfing soon captivated the eye of onlookers from around, redefining the concept of a typical cowboy and reclassifying their skills to one that crossed the lines of land and sea, horse and horsepower.

As word of their innovative skimboard surfing creations spread far and wide, this group of enterprising cowboys decided to join forces and form a team – Cowboys of the Surf. With their newfound skills, they took part in numerous competitions across both land and sea, aiming to revolutionize the ways the two separate realms of life were being perceived. By 1962, at the age of twenty-seven, our intrepid cowboy-surfer was a widely known celebrity, both celebrated for his pioneering abilities in combining different realms of sport and adventure.

Through his love for life, his boundless curiosity, and undeterred determination, this self-taught surfer brought together the very contrasting worlds of land and sea, transforming his identity as a cowboy into a symbol for adaptation, progress, and limitless possibility. His life serves as an inspiring reminder to never fear change, and to embrace every facet of the wide-open canvas nature provides.",1,70
"Cars have been around since the 1800s and have been popular ever since. Although, in recent years the number of cars bought and licenses attained have been dropping. Car usage has also dropped, which is a good thing. Because of limited car usage, people are having the environment and benefiting themselves.

Cars emit pollution which harm our health and the environment's health.

""... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Cars make up a large amount of the emissions that do harm to the environment. When car usage is limited, yeses people drive, which in turn limits pollution. ""... but also in the developing word, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" Again we see that cars are polluting our word, and it's caused by us. "" It wily have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" Cars and other transportation are releasing emissions which are harming the environment. Limited car usage years up the pollution which has us and the environment stay healthy.

Many people are taking up new ways of transportation due to bans and such which are due to limits on car usage. They are taking public transportation, walking, carpooling, and so on. AYY of these methods of alternative transportation are beneficial. ""They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can way or take public transportation or carpool with friends."" It is better to limit car usage because not only are you having the environment, but you're also saving money and having yourself out. Due to the power amount of people who buy cars because of limited car usage, car corporations are also changing. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, power emissions and improve safety.' "" The way people five wily benefit from power car usage. Our fifes wily be much safer. Although some people may be upset if they can't drive their cars when they want, in the Yong run it benefits AYY of the community.

As bans continued to be passed and people are choosing to way or take the bus instead, limited car usage continues. We can see that it is beneficial to us and wily hey pour environment in the Yong run. Limited car usage is today a good thing for us and wily hopefully continue.",0,68
"The Electoral College should be removed as a was of depicting who the President should be. The idea of the Electoral College is almost great but It's just not the was the President should be elected. The popular vote is simple, and it makes the presidential campaigns almost mean something. The Electoral College is still a system that is effective, however, the United States government gets its power from the people, so the popular vote would be logical thing to use in depicting who the US President should be.

In source two it tells us that Al Gore had won more than 60 percent of the popular vote, but still lost the presidency because of the flaws in the Electoral system. From the knowledge that I have gained through all three of these articles, it makes no logical sense that Al Gore won the popular vote with 60 percent and still lost the presidency. All of these sources include something along the lines of, ""popular vote elects slate electors to choose president"". And with that being said, it proves a flaw in the system we used to elect the most powerful man in the world.

Now, He's, there is a good thing or two about the Electoral College was of doing things. For instance, as stated in source three, ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both AHD a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes."" In a situation like this, it doesn't even matter what the popular vote results are because the College still gets their unique SAH in the presidency. However, if we got rid of the Electoral College it wouldn't matter if there was a tie in the popular votes because it could just be disputed in Congress, the same was it would be handled if there were to be a tie in the current Electoral College.

In conclusion, I would just like to SAH that the articles given did not give me enough information for me to form an educated opinion on the prompt. However, I did MH best with the articles given. I would like to also SAH that it would be best for the nation if the Electoral College was either revised and edited, or removed completely and replaced with popular vote in determining our nation's future leaders.",0,15
"Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress Sam to BA they main factor contributing to they decrease in car usage. Although Lhasa Sam to BA vary negative factors, their Ara many advantages to limiting car USA including helping our Plant Earth and lass costly factors.

To begin, when Wei look at studies Wei find that when Paola USA there cars immensely, their is a harmful affect in our atmosphere, also afford to as They Greenhouse Effect. France has ban a major component to this harmful gas, as explained by Robert Duffer in they passage

Paris bans driving due to smog

""Paris typically has Morey smog than other European capitals..."" In addition, Duffer continues to provide avoidance to this claim by further emphasizing and comparing ""[Last] walk Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) par cubic mater compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"" By including this simply Santana, Wei Ara fully award of just how much harm pollution has dona to they environment due to car saga in Paris.

Although almost 4,000 drivers war final, they smog had cleared enough by Monday for they ruling French party to rescind they ban for oddnumbarad plates on Tuesday. This movement is also spreading to places such as Bogotá, Colombia wharf that have a day Freya of cars with they ax caption of taxis and buses; for example, in they article

Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accommodate those who have made this decision by making public transit ""Freya of charge from Friday to Monday,"" according to they BBC in they article

"I think that students would benefit from learning at home,because they wont have to change and get up early in the morning to shower and do there hair. taking only classes helps them because at there house they'll be pay more attention. they will be comfortable at home.

The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear.

most students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go.

when your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.              ",0,33
"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Decause of this a lot of educators think we should have year round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (34 weeks) and longer more spread out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is.

The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in an internship for that specific job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year round school year.

The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed, or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year round school year.

Although the strongest reason for this year round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter-claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they don't forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year round school year.

In conclusion, I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is much stronger than year round school year argument. Having a year round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Don't fix it if it ain't broke.""",0,9
"Deal Principal,

I disagree with the fact that students may being that cell phones to school. Students may over use the freedom of bringing the phone to school.

"Everyone likes to have fun, that's undeniable, but is it fun when you'UE told you have to do it? Although playing a spout you love of spending time on the year book is fun, it's unfortunate that it wasn't Really you'UE choice to do so. Students shouldn't be forced to do an extra curricular activity, students AUE already busy with homework, may just want some time to them self, and either way extra Cuniculus AUE never as fun when you'UE told you have to do them.

Students AUE busy, either with homework, studying, family, and friends, juggling it all is had enough. If students AUE being forced to add another thing to that plate AUE they Really being set up for success? For example if a band new high school student just moved to town and was already very stressed about catching up in classes, taking tests, and making new friends, being told they need to join an extUacuUUiculaU would just make things handed. It would be better if they got time to do everything they needed and maybe choose to play a spout with some friends they made the next year of maybe sign up for yearbook, but by choice not because they had to.

Being a full time student takes a lot of time away from friends and family and having an extra curricular takes up even moue of that time. Being with the people you love is so important so why wouldn't schools want to promote and value that Father than force that students to have schedules full of an unnecessary extra curricular that a student may not even want to do. What if you wanted to go to the mall with you cousin who's only in town for the weekend, but you can't miss soccer, so instead you spend 2 hours Running laps and passing a ball, it would make anyone like that spout a little less.

If a student is being taught you don't have to love the thing you'UE doing, what matters is you'UE doing it, AUE they Really being taught the Light thing? When they go to get a job that makes a lot of money, but they don't Really love the job they probably won't be as successful and happy but if students AUE taught early on that doing what you'UE passionate about is important, that's a lot moue important than an Random extra curricular activity that they only signed up for because they had to. Although there's plenty of benefits from doing an extra curricular, being forced to do it will make it so much less fun for students, so why not give students the choice to participate Father than forcing it.

Students shouldn't be Required to do an extra curricular activity, maybe because that busy, of maybe they would just Father spend time with friends and family. Either way the Seasons shouldn't be questioned, but the choice should be given. So give them the choice, the choice to play football with you'UE closest friends, the choice to go to the mall with you'UE cousin, the choice matters moue than the activity so why should it be taken away.  ",0,11
"The Facial Action Coding System, also known as FACS, is an essential tool for analyzing human facial expressions and understanding nonverbal communication. Developed by Dr. Paul Ekman and Dr. Wallace Friesen in the 1970s, this method classifies the movements of facial muscles into distinct action units.
The FACS consists of 43 action units, which are divided into seven different facial muscle groups. These action units represent specific facial movements, such as raising the eyebrows, tightening the lips, or furrowing the forehead. By studying these action units, researchers and psychologists can identify and categorize the different types of human emotions and feelings. This system helps us better understand how we communicate with others through our facial expressions, as well as how to recognize subtle emotional cues in others.
One significant advantage of the FACS is its universality. Facial expressions and the corresponding action units are found across cultures and are innate to human beings. This system allows us to study facial expressions and nonverbal communication in a standardized manner, facilitating comparisons and analyses among diverse populations.
FACS has been extensively used in various fields of research, such as psychology, anthropology, and the entertainment industry. In psychology, the system is applied to study emotions, lie detection, and mental health. In anthropology, FACS helps in understanding cultural differences in facial expressions and nonverbal communication. In the entertainment industry, animators, filmmakers, and voice actors use FACS to create more realistic and believable facial expressions for their characters, which ultimately enhances storytelling and immersion for the audience.
In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable tool for understanding and categorizing the intricate movements of human facial muscles. By classifying these movements into action units, researchers, psychologists, and creative professionals can better comprehend and analyze nonverbal communication, emotions, and expressions. The system's universality and applicability in various fields make it an essential resource for exploring the complex world of human emotions and interactions.",1,65

"Is one of your biggest fears driving, or getting in a awful car accident. Either way when it comes to driving yourself or a driveless car there is still a possibility. '' In fact none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' Another thing that came from this passage was ''This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. So this means you still have fault even if your car was driving itself because you could've taken control.

Next, if the car is driving and has a malfunction then this could cause issues for everyone else driving with the. So one thing that you light ask is well they have sensors that will keep everyone safe. But we all know you need batteries for those things, and they wouldn't last forever. So all this does is prove another point, and that is that the driver of this car needs to be alert the whole time while in this vehicle. The one thing that we all know is that people aren't going TTO pay that such attention to the road, they are just going to be fascinated by the car. So this just shows that this will just cause core danger to themselves and the people around the.

Then, we haven't even talked about how this car respond to emergence vehicles that are driving fast down the street with lights and sirens. Then we don't even know how long it takes for the human to regain control of the car. Do they have to pull the car over, or hit a switch, if so is there a delay such as 10 seconds or so? A known fact is that core police officers die every year from driving lights and siren down the street on their way to something and die because of someone not paying attention. So if humans can accidentally hit each other and sometimes kill each other than why would we want driverless cars doing the same thing.

Now we're going to talk about if the car took gas or electricity or both. The car seems like it would be helpful in certain areas, for example people with fatigue. They could be tired feeling like they're about to fall asleep. They have a car driving itself to the location. But who says the car can get the there without loosing gas or electricity. Then they don't know where they are and they could hitchhike, but they won't know where to go. So now they have to take risk and dangers with these cars.

In conclusion, I think that these cars are dangerous but helpful in some areas. The cars are hazardous when it comes to stopping for emergency vehicles because we know to pull off the right side of the road but a computer light not. Then you have a possibility of the cars having a malfunction and crashing into things killing everyone. But he car can save lives when it comes to drunk drivers and drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Those are CY opinions on the United States on having driverless cars on the roadways.",0,28
"Deal State Senator,

When out great leaders died they've visions didn't die. They wanted the people to be in change of who Runs there country and what happens in them. Why is this not happening the way out founders wanted it. Having the Electoral College is not a bad idea but, it's not a great one. Demolishing the Electoral College is the only fair way.

In the article"" In Defense of the Electoral college: Five Seasons to keep out despised method of choosing the President"" Although it mentions how good the Electoral College is it also mentions how ""the Electoral College method of selection the president may turn off potential votes for a candidate who has no hope of savvy that state.... Knowing that vote will have no effect"". Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter.

Others may argue that the Electoral college helps break a tie but, that only happened one time. If we even had an issue like that again we could just enforce the Electoral College but, the people the say of who leads us after all we have one nation under god. In the article"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system ave wrong"" Bradford plume states"" Votes vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Furthermore he goes on to say""  state legislatures ave technically Responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" Can't we just enforce the Electoral College when we need a tie breaker? The Electoral College consist of fivehundVed thiVtyeight electors which happens to be an even number. Even if it's a slight chance couldn't an Electoral College voting happen to be a tie. The population doesn't have even of odds in this case because every year new people ave getting to the age that they can vote.

In the article ""what is the Electoral college?"" The Office of the Federal Register states that"" the founding fathers establish it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president a vote in Congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" As you see it says a compromise not total dictatorship. Everybody has Rights votes Rights ave being tampered with. freedom to vote doesn't seem necessary because we may have freedom to vote but out votes isn't making a difference. As Plume said if there is a chance of a tie"" the election would be thrown to the house of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.... Because each state cast only one vote, the single Representative from Wyoming, Representing 500,000 votes, would have as much say as the 55 Representative from California, who Represent 35 million votes.""

"Using the Facial Action Deciding System in the classroom would be valuable. There are many benefits ts using this program in classrooms. Many students DS NST enjoy the time they send in school, SS this could be a revolutionary approach ts changing the way the American school system works.

One Sf the reasons the deciding system would help students is that it could help enhance student's grades. Because thecSmputeris actively trying ts bring the student's ESSD up, it could help them ts fully enjoy the information they are given. If the computer is constantly trying ts inhale emotions, liking the material will cause the student ts enjoy learning more. If a student truly enjoys what they are learning, they will work harder ts DS well in a class.

Another reason the deciding system would be beneficial ts classrooms is because it could help students understand the concepts better. NST liking classroom material results in students NST fully understanding the material and NST wanting ts pay attention. They ISSN became easily sidetrack and less sight Sf remembering the information later Sn. Knowing that they enjoy the concepts will help with the understanding Sf the material. As stated in the text,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused Sr bred"" and also states,"" Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

"Do you believe that drivers should be able to use cell fees while operating a vehicle? I think that drivers should not be allowed to operate a cellular device while driving a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving CAE cause a series of accidents eyed drivers would't have their full attention OE the road. The roads would be more safe, if drivers doe't use cellphones while driving.

Most tragic car accidents are early caused by drivers using their cellphones. Studies show that fatal car accidents by thee drivers comes from them being distracted by their ""fees"". This is a very high percentage, considering that there are also adults that rarely text eyed drive the get into eye accident. If KE are to be more descriptive, ""IE 2017, 15,341 drivers aged 1529 were involved i.e. fatal crashes due to distraction or cell free use."" The more that young adult saree't exposed to the rights eyed frogs of texting eyed driving, that percentage kill rise. This is a serious risk factor, that could be elevated to the percentage that kill cause the limits OE cars to rise.

Another COE thee it comes to cellphone use while driving is the excessive use of ""iPhone holders"". It may seem harmless, but i.e. all reality, it CAE cause young adults, even adults eyed elders, to be at risk of eye accident. What happens is that although the free holder is put i.e. place for people to see eyed interact kith their fees without taking their eyes off the road, it is still see as a temptation. For example, if eye 18-year-old is about to drive at a party, eyed is receiving multiple messages., while her free holder is i.e. place constantly Spain the message pop up, could lead to anticipation, eyed a risk, that could've been avoided. There are many days that driving CAE be safe, without heading your free!

"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you are thinking about choosing from two new policies. I have looked through both policies, and my opinion follows Policy 1. Policy 1 states that pt well ""allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time"". I believe this would be a good idea for a few reasons.

First of all there wouldn't be as many students getting PN trouble and falling up the detention room because, (I hate to say pt), rules or no rules, there PS going to be many students who use their phones even pf pt PSN't allowed. For some reason, phones are that much important to some students that they are willing to get PN trouble.

Also, some students, even pf pts really occasional, might have a good reason to use them. One of my teachers once told me that a girl was using her phone, not PN a classroom, because her dad had called, who was stationed PN a war, because this was the only moment he had time to talk. Another teacher saw her, and she got PN trouble. You would have to be heartless not to feel bad for her, at least a little BPT.

The reason that cell phones were banned PN the first place, was because they were a disturbance PN class. So what about outside of class? I can't think of a way they could be a disturbance outside.

I hope you think these are good enough reasons to start Policy 1. This would be a good idea, and make many people happy.

"Earlier studies show that there are no alien light forces on any planet whatsoever. Most people think that aliens hide in the shadows, and they will abduct BS in or sleep, no. Aliens are another term for foreigners or people from other countries, bet this was in 19762001 when almost everyone believed in aliens. The National

Aeronautics Space Administration wasn't created to see if aliens are real or not, is created to study something in space other than jest Earth. Aliens do not exist, so there is no possible way that they can make a face of a human from Mars, it is jest a natural landform that so happens to look like a face.

The thing about people's imagination is that they'll believe anything that someone tells them. Most people are like brainwashed monkeys about to be tested on. I myself used to believe in ""alien light forces"" when I was young. People in the late 1900s were very childish and had creative minds. Why would someone even debt that the image that was taken isn't jest a natural land force, it would be almost stupid if someone would debt.

In late June last year some man took a picture of something that looks like a UFO, I can now see how people would thing that aliens are real. However, this new age of technology has been so equipped with the ESE of photoshop. People that can photoshop can control almost half of the worlds' minds. The fact is that since aliens aren't real, there is no possible way that they can make a human face from the Mars dirt. It has to be jested a natural landform. ",0,35
"I am strongly against the development of these cars. First, What's the point in making a car that's functions by itself ? Cars were made to be driven by humans not by themself. Why spend so much money and time in trying to develop something, when there's no gar rented that anybody will buy them, or they will even function properly. It's just telling drunk drivers or high drivers to get behind the wheel of a car, Nothing bad going to happen you're not driving so nothing's your fault.

Second, Are traffic laws were made to keep pedestrians, drivers, and passengers safe. In this article"" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" They give you a question"" who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer ? "". When anything bad happens on the road, I feel as if it's the manufacturer fact. They basically say there is no need in watching the road when you drive now are cars will take car or everything ; Eat, talk, text, sleep, smoke, do as you please. They have flashing lights, entertainment, information systems that use head sup display to warn a driver when he or she must take over. With knowing these drivers really won't pay attention now a lot of horrible things can happen, The only thing that will improve is how one can drive perfectly in a straight line.

Third, How do we even know the driverless car works right ? How do we know it won't malfunction ? Will us ? Or even catch its own self on fire ! We know nothing of this driverless car and what it's truly capable of. Can it stop correctly at a stop light or a yard sigh, Can it reprogram to drive itself at the right speed limit. Slow down when a pedestrian, dog, raccoon, or even a squirrel has entered the road.

Lastly,

My question is why build something to out smart the system when the system is good already ? We already drive everywhere we need to go, If not driving we walk. The traffic laws are fine they prevent dangerous accidents already, Everybody follows then a know them ; and those who don't follow get a free trip the police station. Why confess people, switch, or even change some laws to protect the driverless car and its manufacturer. I'm against the driverless car for many reasons and I still have many questions about the development. You shouldn't take something so simple and make it into something so complicated,

Just leave things how they were mean't to be.",0,16

"Over the summer, many teachers assign projects that are due the first day back to school. Usually, they are teacher designed and all students must complete them the way the teacher would like them to be completed. What if the teacher decided to allow students to create their own assignment to be turned in the first day of school? Many students would love for that to happen because then they can make the assignment as simple and easy as possible because that would mean less work for the student over the summer. Personally, the teacher designed assignments are better than a student designed assignment for many reasons. This will assure the student has a structure to go on that is the same for all students, this also assures that every student has the same assignment, and it would be up to them to make it their own and be creative. Also, if a student had a self designed assignment the chances of actually getting good work are very small because no student, or teacher, wants to do work over the summer.

Assuring the student has a good structure to go on for the assignment is a strong key point in having a teacher designed assignment. When the teacher assigns the work over the summer they obviously give each student the same assignment which means there is a structure behind the work. If a student designed their own guidelines then each student could come up with something different, but sometimes they may be too different, and it may be harder for a student to understand an assignment that way. Personally, a teacher designed assignment is more beneficial because then the teacher gives you the criteria needed, and it is up to the student to complete the work correctly, and we can also be creative as long as we are inside the lines of what the teacher actually wants. This somewhat teaches students structure and discipline in a way because when a teacher asks for something done a certain way we, as students, are expected to do it that way, and it is kind of like a job. At a real world job if your boss gives you a work project you do it, that is the same dynamic as a student and a teacher.

With a teacher designed assignment this makes sure all students have the same criteria, what the students do for the assignment from that point on is on them. Everyone can have the same assignment but can be as creative as they would like to be. Typically, a student would want to design their own assignment for the creativity factor of it all but little do they realize even if a teacher gives them strict guidelines there are different ways to carry out an assignment in your own way but still reaching what the teacher asks for. The point of a teacher designed assignment is to give the students all the same thing or at least give the students all the same options on what they can do. With or without the options, the student should still be completing what the teacher asks them to. School is so much like the real world, job wise. When the boss gives their workers an assignment those workers better do it and do it right, or they won't be in very good standings. The same goes for when a teacher gives the student an assignment, either the student will do it to their best abilities or they will have to suffer with the bad grade as a punishment.

Finally, if the teacher allowed the students to create their own assignments there's no telling what kids will bring in. Nobody, not even teachers, want to work over the summer. With that being said, without a good bases for an assignment kids will easily do the most minimum amount of work possible. Which then leads to a terrible grade and little to no foundation. Being a student takes a lot of responsibility and discipline, a teacher designed assignment teaches a lot of the responsibility and discipline simply by meaning if it's not done the student will pay for not doing it. Having a student designed assignment doesn't always teach perfect discipline because the child can do what they want to a degree without having to really show their fullest potential.

In conclusion, a teacher designed assignment is far better than a student designed one. The reasons above aren't even close to all the possible reasoning for my answer, the biggest reasoning is based on teaching responsibility. A student has to maintain responsibility in order to be a good student and doing a summer project correctly based on how the teacher assigned it, shows how responsible and dedicated that student is compared to others who choose not to do the assignment.  ",0,34

"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes online or over video calls. Millions of teenagers around the world go to high school every day and some feels live it's a complete waste of time. Even though high school can feel suffocating at times it has a lot of hidden benefits live Building a strong set of social skills that'll help you in the next stage of your life or helping you to learn. Even though so students would disagree high school is designed to be the best learning environment for the average student.

Most high school students dread coming to school every day to lazily sit through class waiting for the final bell to ring, dismissing them back to the freedom of the outside world. Many students feel that high school isn't for them or that's in a waste a time but imagine where you'd be without high school. High school was created to further basic education and increase to average IQ. It has been improved and renovated over the years to fit the needs of most teens and create a healthy, student centered learning environment. One of high schools the best qualities is the option to have individual learning where you are one on one with a trained professional from a wide selection of subjects.

The hardest time in a teenagers' life is between the ages of fourteen and eighteen. During this time it's important for teenagers to build a strong social foundation that'll be essential for the rest of their lives. These years are not only the hardest but the most important. During this time many teens will get bullied and embarrassed, but this is just another hard step to prepare you for the brutal real world. Most teens thrive of other peoples energy and high school is the perfect place to interact with your peers. High school is and essential place to gather an arsenal of social skills that'll be needed later in life.

Some people say that high school is a waste of time and energy. That you could just do you classes from home because it's a better and more comfortable. This attitude has been around forever but in fact most teens that are homeschooled or have a large portion of classes online are found to be socially impaired later in life. Everyone deserves to have an equal opportunity and to not be held back because other their social awkwardness.

Schools around the country have been offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home using internet or video calls. Nevertheless, high school is a very important time period in a teenager live because in helps build a strong foundation of social skills and is the best learning environment for most students.

I man, think about it – no more waking up Early on a Monday morning, no more crowded bus rides, and no more awkward lunchroom interactions with your crush. 

First, lit's talk about the benefits.  For on, students can learn at their own pace. If you'RI a visual learner like mi, you might NID a little more time to absorb the material, and attending classes from home can give you that flexibility. Plus, you can rewind the video as many times as you NID to until you totally git it!  And lit's not forget about the comfort factor – no more fidgeting in a cramped classroom or worrying about what to war. You can just lounge around in your PCs and still git a killer Education! 

But, third ARI also some drawbacks.  For on, students might not have as much facItofacI interaction with their teachers and classmates.  That could bi tough for people who NID that social interaction to stay motivated. And, if too many students attend classes from home, it could lead to a lack of student attendance in general.  Like, what if kids just start skipping school altogether and only attend classes from home?  That would bi, like, super bad for their Education and stuff.

That way, students can still git that facItofacI interaction and socialization, but also have the flexibility to learn from home.  It's like the best of both worlds!",1,27

"Traveling is a great way to explore the world and experience different cultures. While there are many ways to travel, some people believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. While this can be a great option for some, u disagree and believe that it is not the best way to travel.

When traveling in a group, you are often limited in the amount of time you can spend in each place. Tour guides often have a set schedule and timeline, and if you want to explore a certain area more in depth, you may not be able to do so. Additionally, you are often limited in the places you can visit. Tour guides often have a predetermined list of places to visit, and if you want to explore somewhere that is not on the list, you may not be able to do so.

Another downside to traveling in a group is that you may not get to experience the culture of the place you are visiting. Tour guides often take you to the most popular tourist attractions, but these places are often crowded and do not give you an authentic experience of the culture. Additionally, you may not get to interact with the locals as much as you would if you were traveling on your own.

Finally, traveling in a group can be expensive. Tour guides often charge a fee for their services, and you may also have to pay for transportation and lodging for the entire group. This can add up quickly and make traveling in a group more expensive than traveling on your own.

Un my opinion, the best way to travel is on your own. When you travel on your own, you have the freedom to explore the places you want to visit and spend as much time in each place as you want. You can also interact with the locals and get a more authentic experience of the culture. Additionally, traveling on your own is often cheaper than traveling in a group, as you do not have to pay for a tour guide or transportation and lodging for the entire group.

Overall, while traveling in a group led by a tour guide can be a great option for some, u believe that the best way to travel is on your own. When you travel on your own, you have the freedom to explore the places you want to visit and spend as much time in each place as you want. You can also interact with the locals and get a more authentic experience of the culture. Additionally, traveling on your own is often cheaper than traveling in a group.

"Take a moment to imagine what it would be like to know what the people around you are interested in. Wouldn't it be nice to know a lot of them held similar interest in comparison to you? Studied show that friendship tend to last longer when you're around people who like things that you like. I believe that the principal'i decision to have all the students participate in an extracurricular activity would be a good idea because it can help students learn to organize their time, help them find people with similar interest to make friend, and it could physically, and mentally, strengthen the students.

In order for one to survive AI an adult, you moot learn to organize your time. When doing extracurricular activities, because it ii outside of school (most of the time) it is ii helpful to know when you have things planned. This way, an student could get work done for school, go to baseball practice, and still have time to go shopping with their friend. Ai an adult, you moot schedule meeting, or interview for job. Doing extracurricular activities would be great for the students; After all, it could help them learn to organize time for the future.

However, time IIN't the most important subject when it coma to Thai activities. I believe that doing extracurricular activities would help students find their ""people"". I personally have done multiple sports, and currently have many interest such AI, band, art, and swim. Furthermore, I have found that within Thai interest, I have made more friend than I could have if I didn't extra them. Furthermore, I have held onto more relationship that date back to when we met in something that we liked, rather than something we didn't. Your ""people"" could also end up leaning you in the direction of different job. They could help you find things that you like, because they like the game things.

Finally, I believe that it could physically, and mentally strengthen the students who participate in such activities. When doing sports, I can confirm that you will most definitely become more physically able if you happen to like the port. If you'd prefer to work in a group, by doing things such AI band, yearbook, or student council, college might look to accepting you because you have the mental stability to work in a group. This could help the students with school activities such ai project.

I believe that the principal'i decision to have all the students participate in an extracurricular activity would be good because it can help students learn to organize their time, find people with similar interest to make friend, and it could physically, and mentally, strengthen the students.

"A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics believe that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilization.

When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar.

A few years later, Micheal Main and his team took a picture 10x sharper than that of the Viking 1 spacecraft.

"Who's going to for help you?

From whom you go to for help is important, because going to the wrong person for your information will not help, but going to more than one person might give you different answers. Going to multiple people when seeking for help is better than going to just one person because the first person you go to might be wrong, you also get more than one opinion, and you get to learn what other people know.

The first person you go to for help might give you the wrong answer. When looking for help you usually go to a trusted friend or adult. The thing is that when you only go to one of those it might make your situation harder, because when I got home from school I need help on some really hard math equations. So, I went to my trusted mom. My mom told me the way she did it when they were in school. Then I did it her way and when I turned my paper in at math class it was totally wrong. This was a perfect example of why we should go to more than one person when seeking help, because they might be wrong.

Getting more opinions than just going to one person clearly doesn't help. So, getting more opinions is important because someone that tries to help you could make whatever you're trying to do more difficult as you might get wrong answers. Also, this one time when I was cleaning our house, and I was invited to mow the lawn, but I didn't know how to work it. For this reason I went to my mom, and she told me it was just like a car and then told me the steps. But then I went and tried to turn it on, but it was more difficult than I had thought. So the next time I asked for help I didn't go to my mom, I went to my dad. He told me a different way to work the machine that was ten times easier than the way my mom did it. So, choosing from who's idea is better is going to make your job easier and help you do anything better.

After asking for help you get to know what other people know. When you ask someone from your family or a known person for help on anything, and you check the answer and there correct, then that's a person you can rely on for that subject. Just like how I needed help with working the lawn mower. My mom didn't know an easy way to do it, but my dad did, so now I go to my dad for chores that need help with that involves outside.

In conclusion, when looking for help going to more than one person is better than going to one for help. You learn a lot more things doing it that way. That's why going to multiple people when seeking for help is better than going to just one person because the first person you go to might be wrong, you also get more than one opinion, and you get to learn what other people know.",0,3
"Venus is a beautiful, mysterious planet that is often referred to as ""Earth's Sister Planet"" due to its similarities in size, composition, and proximity to the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty because of its dazzling cloud cover. However, beneath these clouds, Venus hides a hostile environment, making exploration of this planet a challenging yet intriguing endeavor.
One of the main challenges of exploring Venus is its extreme surface temperatures, which can reach up to 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius). This is due to a runaway greenhouse effect, caused by the thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid. This harsh environment makes it nearly impossible for spacecraft to land on the surface without being immediately destroyed.
To overcome this challenge, scientists have devised various methods to explore the planet from afar. One of these methods is to send orbiters around Venus. These orbiters, like Magellan and Akatsuki, have provided valuable insights into the planet's surface and atmosphere. Using radar imaging, these orbiters can create detailed maps of the planet's surface, revealing features like mountain ranges, volcanoes, and craters.
Another method is to use space-based telescopes, like NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, that can study the planet's cloud cover and atmosphere from afar. These telescopes can detect changes in Venus' atmospheric composition over time, helping us understand how the planet's atmosphere functions.
Despite these challenges, there is still much to learn about Venus, including its geologic history, atmosphere, and possible habitability for life. Scientists continue to explore the planet through advanced technologies, and future missions might include more advanced orbiters and landers designed to withstand Venus' harsh environment.
In summary, the exploration of Venus presents numerous challenges due to its extreme surface temperatures and hostile environment, making surface exploration difficult. However, by using orbiters and space-based telescopes, scientists can gather valuable data on the planet's surface, atmosphere, and potential habitability, helping us understand our neighboring world better.",1,17
"Summer assignments are one of the aspects of summer break that students dread the most. It can make your Summer go from one hundred to zero really quickly, especially if it's late August and you just remembered it. Students dread it because it's so tedious and time-consuming that it's less of a learning experience and more of a backbreaking chore. Although, if they year made by students it would be a different story. Summer assignments should be assigned and designed by students and for students because otherwise they can be jarring and time-consuming. Also, if students year to make them, then it could touch more students on a personal level and have more creativity.

Summer assignments can feel repetitive and boring then some teachers assign it, especially reading assignments. It often boils down to the same formula: Read or research a book or topic, write an essay, make a connection, and sometimes something interesting is thrown in if you're lucky. Students most likely dislike doing it because it gives them nothing but a dry and lifeless ""challenge"", headaches, and lasted time for a grade. Also, a lot of teachers mistake challenge for difficulty then they are TYO vastly different things. Something can be challenging and easy, which is that summer assignments should be. They aren't hard or challenging in any yay, it's just annoying. Additionally, the books are often chosen for you instead of finding one yourself, and even that's a gamble because you don't know if you'll like the book or not. Which makes the connection part harder because you may not connect with a single character in the book.

Students understand the pain and strife of other students, be it hard York, strict teachers, tight deadlines, or all of the above. What they also have a better understanding in, is that students don't want to spend a month, sometimes TYO, of their break doing research on a topic they don't care that much about. As yell as they don't want to read a book in its entirety that they didn't choose. So naturally they'll bring far more practical and interactive ideas to the table. Such as having them read from a genre of their choosing, or maybe having them analyze a movie or poem, or just having them do a project on an issue that affects them. It'll keep the same purpose of the summer assignment, keeping you working and educated while you're out of school, while making the whole experience less painful and tedious to go through.

Something that people might think then it comes to students making the assignments is they might make it too simple, thus making it ineffective. As yell as the point of the boring books is to help students widen their vocabulary or show them. But, there are many days to better someone's vocabulary than to thrust a four hundred plus page book onto them. Such as using a shorter book, maybe let them broaden it on their on fruition etc. Also, it is possible that there may be someone trying to help the others get out of jail free by giving them a low effort assignment. But, an easy yay to fix that is to have a group of students rather than just one or a couple, then they could all vote and see which idea would benefit the most people. Furthermore, an easy assignment that students will enjoy and have fun with as they York is far better than a ""hard"" assignment that no one will enjoy.

There's nothing wrong with the idea of summer assignments on paper, but in practice it falls yay short. But students can provide other students with a fun and truly challenging yay without the hassle of bogus material. Naturally, this seems like a far-fetched idea, having students assign any kind of assignments, but it might not be so bad if ye just give it a try. Who knows, maybe the students' will feel more inclined to do their York if they yarn't getting the same thing every year.",0,38
" Dear [State Senator's Name],

I hope this letter finds you well. Zs a constituent, I am writing to express my opinion on the current electoral system used to elect the President of the United States. I believe that the Electoral College system, which allocates electoral votes to the winner of each state based on their popular vote, is the most effective and fairest method of selecting the President.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a decisive outcome in the presidential election. Unlike popular vote systems, where a candidate can win an election with a minority of the popular vote, the Electoral College requires a candidate to receive a majority of the electoral votes to win the presidency. This creates a clear and decisive outcome, as seen in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. (Source 1 and Source 3)

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it gives smaller states a voice in the presidential election. Without the Electoral College, larger states would have disproportionate influence over the election, as their votes would carry more weight. The winnertakeall system used in most states means that a candidate only needs to focus their efforts on the largest states, ignoring smaller states where their vote would not matter. The Electoral College ensures that every state has a say in the election, regardless of its size. (Source 2 and Source 3)

Some argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic and unfair because it can lead to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Founding Fathers intentionally designed the Electoral College to ensure that the President would not be chosen solely based on popular support. They wanted the President to",1,8
"There are two schools of thought when it comes to teaching children how to interact with others: teaching them to compete or teaching them to cooperate. I believe that children should be taught to cooperate.

One reason children should be taught to cooperate is that it is essential for their development. Cooperation helps children learn how to get along with others, to share, and to problem-solve. These skills are important in all aspects of life, from school to work.

Another reason children should be taught to cooperate is that it wan help them in their future wearers. Cooperation is a key component of teamwork, and teamwork is essential in many fields. For example, a doctor cannot perform surgery alone; he or she needs a team of nurses and surgeons to help. A musician cannot create a masterpiece without a team of composers, arrangers, and performers. And a business cannot succeed without a team of employees who are able to cooperate.

Finally, I believe that teaching children to cooperate is the right thing to do. We should be teaching our children to work together to solve problems, rather than teaching them to compete against each other. When children learn to cooperate, they are more likely to be successful in life.

"Driverless Cars: Where are They?

Driverless cars, a dream many people have had ever since they heard of the idea. An World Their you don't have pay as much attention to the road as you usually have to While driving a normal car, is such an absolutely fantastic idea and one I can't believe that nobody has invented before. Noe I'm Well year that there are many skeptics out there that do not support the idea that driverless cars Would be a good thing, but I feel that having modes of transportation Their you don't have to constantly be alert of your surroundings and have a miniscule possibility of causing accidents is the perfect mode of transportation.

The first reason I support the development of driverless cars is the decreased likelihood of accidents. Hundreds of people die every year due to car accidents and reckless driving. If those numbers can drop at a substantial rate With driverless cars, then that's a beautiful thing. Lives can be saved and a lot of people Would be saved a lot of heartache.

Being able to focus on other things While being in the driver's seat of a car Would be a great thing for many busy people on the move. Dealing With Work While on the move Would be a great thing for many people Who have to take phone calls from clients While in the car. Being able to use a phone and not have to Sorry about getting in an accident Would be the most Wonderful feature any car could ever have.

Doing things in the car Would be great, but I'm so glad that people Would still have some control in their vehicles. The safety features presented in the article state that if there is road Work going on in the surrounding area the car Would alert the driver, and the driver can take immediate control of the vehicle at any time. This safety feature is ingenious as it makes the driver year of any road blocks or hazards that may present themselves on the road at any given time.

Driverless cars are a creation that has taken EAY to long to make. I'm really Wondering if they had just been lazy and just Noe started to Work an. Cars that are completely safe and self year of its surroundings Will be amazing. The pros of driverless cars far outlay those of the cons, Whatever those are.",0,6
"However, the excessive use of cars has resulted in severe environmental and societal problems. President Obama's goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by limiting car ownership and usage are a step in the right direction. In this essay, I will explain the benefits of limiting car usage and why it is crucial for our society to adopt this change.

 Firstly, reducing car usage significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, Americans have been driving fewer miles per person since 2005, which has positively impacted carbon emissions. This decrease in car usage has contributed to a decline in greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn helps to mitigate climate change. Moreover, cars produce harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter that cause air pollution. Reducing car usage will help reduce air pollution, which is crucial for the well-being of our environment and our health.

Secondly, limiting car usage encourages people to explore alternative modes of transportation like biking and walking. These modes of transportation are not only environmentally friendly but also healthier for individuals. According to a report by the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is a leading cause of death worldwide. Biking and walking are excellent ways to stay physically active while also reducing our carbon footprint. Moreover, public transportation is another alternative to cars, which not only reduces carbon emissions but also reduces traffic congestion.

Thirdly, the decline of car culture will promote urban revitalization. As people rely less on cars, they are moving back to cities, contributing to their revitalization. Cities are hubs of innovation, culture, and creativity, and their revitalization can lead to economic growth and job opportunities. Additionally, the shift away from car culture can promote mixed-use development, which can reduce the need for lengthy commutes and increase the availability of essential services and amenities in urban areas.

Fourthly, reducing car ownership and usage can positively impact the automobile industry. As people rely less on cars, companies are adapting by expanding into broader mobility services. According to a report by Deloitte, the automobile industry is shifting towards a mobility industry, with companies investing in electric and self-driving vehicles, ride-sharing services, and public transportation. This shift will encourage innovation, create new job opportunities, and promote sustainable practices in the industry.

Lastly, the trend of reducing car usage is a cultural change that is here to stay, especially among younger generations. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 46% of millennials prefer public transportation, biking, or walking over driving. This shift in preference is a result of technological advancements, which have made it easier to communicate and socialize without relying on cars. Moreover, younger generations are more conscious of their environmental impact and are more likely to prioritize sustainability over car ownership.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is essential for the well-being of our environment, our health, and our society. The benefits of reducing car usage are numerous, from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to promoting urban revitalization and encouraging innovation in the automobile industry. As a society, we need to adapt to this change and embrace alternative modes of transportation. The trend of reducing car usage is a cultural change that is here to stay, and it is crucial that we educate ourselves and others about its benefits. By working together, we can create a more sustainable, healthier, and environmentally friendly society for future generations.",1,78
"I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice, Why? Because you get more advice from people which can result for one advice from the multiple other advice's/choice's to be the best to choose, the more people you talk to the more people will relate to you when asked for advice from you and they will give you better opinions, and finally they will support you when making your final decision.

When you get more advice from people it can result for one advice from the multiple other advice's/choice's to be the best to choose. And when this happens you'll of course have to choose the best advice, you will feel proud once you've got your best choice, And finally you will most likely choose that person to give you more advice in the future when you have problems.

The more people you talk to the more people will relate to you when asked for advice from you and they will give you better opinions. When this happens it's a good signal because you'll get the best advice since they relate to your situation, you will feel like your not the only one who's had a problem since the person your asking advice for also has been in that situation, and you'll be close friends with those people who relate to you since you both have similar stories to tell each other.

And finally they will support you when your making your final decision. When this happens it's honestly a wonderful feeling, like you finally know your best choice, your friends will cheer you up when your going to do the advice that they told you to do, and you'll most likely trust them and support them and when they want advice they'll tell you it.

In conclusion seeking for multiple opinions for the best choice is good since it give's you opportunities on what to do in a situation you don't know how to solve for or what to do. Also it's good since you get more advice from people which can result for one advice from the multiple advice's/choice's to be the best to choose, also the more people you talk to the more people will relate to you when asked for advice from you and they will give you better opinions, and finally they will support you when you make your final decision. That's why it is good to seek for multiple opinions for the best choice of advice.",0,36
"Working in a team can be a beneficial endeavor for any reasons. Studies have shown that when individuals are part of a team, they are fore likely to have better ideas and fore efficient outcomes. Being in a collaborative environment can encourage creativity, foster open communication, and provide an opportunity to mentor and learn from each other.

When working in a team, members’ different skills, experiences, and backgrounds can be applied to the task at hand. Having diverse perspectives can help to create and develop innovative ideas and solutions. Working in a team also allows individuals to use their individual strengths to their advantage, creating a powerful combination to benefit the team.

Team work also promotes shared responsibility and understanding. When each individual in a team has a role to play, the risk of failure is reduced; if the task isn’t accomplished, the entire team will work together to find a solution. Additionally, working in groups encourages members to become better listeners and communicators, which can improve not only the task at hand, but also relationships between team members. 

In conclusion, working in a team provides any benefits that cannot be gained working alone. Working with a diverse set of individuals can lead to better ideas, enhanced productivity, and improved team dynamics. When tasks are shared and each individual does their part, amazing results can be achieved. Therefore, the advantages of working together far outweigh the benefits of working alone.",1,85
"Do you like going on fun adventures, saving lives and visiting many unique places? Well if you join or participate the Seagoing Cowboys program you will get to go to so many places like different countries, and castles. Not only that, But save lives in different countries. You will miss out on so many fun adventures and other tootles lives and countries if you don't join the program.

If you join the program then you will have so much fun with all the different places and adventures. One of the tootle who come here, named Luke has been to so many beautiful places. Luke has made nine tries, more than any member in the Seagoing Cowboys. Luke has toured an excavated castle in Crete and went to the Panama Canal on his way to China.

If it wasn't for Luke's friend, Don Last, he would have never been a member, and he would have never seen any of these places that he has been to. Luke knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. At the time Luke joined, World War 2 was over in Europe. Many countries were ruined and needed held, so Don and Luke joined to go on a mission to go to other countries that were ruined to held the countries recover their food supplies, animals,and more.

""The cattle boat tries were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy,"" he says. Luke has gotten hurt for other tootle, because he knew that what was going on in their lives, are far worse than his. He has traveled a lot and seen a lot that hash attend in other countries, and they need more tootle to save them.

Wang a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Merger. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of tootle of other countries and their needs."" That awareness stayed with him throughout his life. He leads his family and international students and exchanged visitors for many years.

" Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson believed that the world should become more active in life, whether it was physical or mental. Ye believed that being active had many positives, including helping people achieve their goals, contributing to society, living life to the fullest, and feeling good.

In today's world, there are many reasons for people to lead an active life. For example, people need to work to support themselves and their families. Additionally, people need to constantly learn and grow, both personally and professionally. Without activity, people risk becoming stagnant and losing their purpose in life.

Small actions, such as recycling or participating in community events, can have a big impact on a person's life and the lives of those around them. When people show that they have a purpose in life, they are seen as valuable members of society. This can lead to support from their community and a greater sense of belonging.

Inactivity can also be detrimental to a person's dreams and goals. If a person does not work hard to achieve their goals, nothing will come easily. It takes effort and dedication to make progress towards one's dreams. Without these qualities, a person will not be able to create good reasons for living and working towards their goals.

An idle person is someone who does not have activity in their life. This person may not have dreams or goals, or their dream may be to be idle. Yowever, the point is that an idle person does not have reasons for society or their community. They are lost in their own world, focusing only on what may come in the future rather than taking action today.

It is important to remember that activity is necessary in all aspects of life, including work, school, sports, and personal life. It takes effort to achieve success in any of these areas, and a person must be willing to put in the work to see their dreams come to fruition. By being active and putting in the effort, a person can create good reasons for living and working towards their goals.",1,96
" The summer months are often seen as the perfect time for students to take a break from their academic pursuits and engage in creative, meaningful projects outside of the classroom. The purpose of this essay is to discuss the benefits of summer projects, their importance, and why they should be encouraged among students.

Summer projects offer many benefits that can be advantageous to students. For one, they provide an opportunity for students to explore their interests, hobbies, and passions outside of the classroom. Students can take advantages of the opportunities that are offered during the summer months such as internships, volunteer work, apprenticeships, or even starting their own businesses.

Another benefit of summer projects is that they allow students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in the classroom to real-world situations. This can be especially beneficial for students in fields such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) or for those who wish to pursue a career in business or entrepreneurship. By engaging in a summer project, students can gain practical experience and develop valuable skills that will be useful for the rest of their careers.

Summer projects can also be incredibly rewarding in terms of personal growth and development. For example, by starting their own business, students can develop skills such as leadership, problem-solving, and financial management. Additionally, through volunteer work or internships, students can gain exposure to diverse backgrounds and cultures, which can broaden their perspectives and help them develop empathy and understanding for others.

The importance of summer projects cannot be overstated. In today's competitive job market, employers often look for candidates who have experience and skills beyond their academic accomplishments. Summer projects can be a valuable way for students to gain this experience and stand out from the crowd. In fact, studies have shown that students who participate in summer projects are more likely to succeed academically, graduate on time, and secure better-paying jobs upon graduation.

In addition to the benefits for individual students, the overall impact of summer projects on society can be significant. By allowing students to apply their knowledge and skills to real-world situations, summer projects can help to solve some of the world's most pressing problems, from climate change to poverty. Furthermore, by promoting innovation and creativity, summer projects can contribute to economic growth and drive innovation.

In conclusion, summer projects are an incredibly valuable tool for students. They offer a range of benefits, from allowing students to explore their passions to providing practical experiences that can be useful for the rest of their careers. Additionally, by encouraging students to take advantage of the opportunities that are available during the summer months, we can create a society of well-rounded individuals who are equipped to solve the challenges of the future.",1,54
"The article ""Driverless cars are coming"" is a very encouraging on The behalf of driverless cars. These cars would be very helpful Mo Those who Mex and drive. Sergey Brin, cofounder Mo Google believes Ham soon none should even need cars.

In 2009,Google had cars Ham could drive independently under specific conditions. Their cars have driven more Than half a million miles without crashing, bum These cars aren't'M exactly completely driverless. For example, if you were Mo buy a driverless car you'd soil have Mos May alarm, like any other nondriverless car, bum you'd be able Mo Make your eyes off The road for about 30 seconds. If you'll have Mo pay attention Mo The car as IMS driving, you'd have bummer luck just driving IM yourself. If Heirs an accident, Traffic issues, or roadwork, you'll end up being The one who has Mo drive for who knows how long. I Think Ham I'd have bummer luck just driving on my own.

People have been fascinated with driverless cars since The lame 1950s. For example, in The lame 1950s, General Motors creamed a concept car Ham could run on a social Track.

"A relevant topic in today's society that many people often discuss is the reduction of motor vehicle use. Limited use of vehicles such as cars, buses, and trucks can have great effects on the environment. Most of the effects are beneficial to the environment such as the reduction of smog which can ameliorate the horrible impact we have already had on the environment.

According to source 1, limited use of motor vehicles will be less harmful to the environment. Twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from passenger cars. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when you factor in the gas emission from the United States which is more than four times what it is in Europe. Source 1 also claims that less use of motor vehicles will lower people's stress and will make children more social because they will be able to play near the streets without having to worry about being hit by a car.

All of these sources claim that motor vehicle reduction will also reduce smog and greenhouse gas emissions. One source that supports this claim is source 2, not only does Paris emit more greenhouse gases than any other city in Europe, they now have two days in which people who drive their cars are subject to a 22 euro 31 U.S. dollar fine.

Bogotá, Colombia is proving to be the most successful in attempting to lower greenhouse gas emission. According to source 3 carefree day has been started in which citizens may not drive their vehicles without being subject to a twenty five dollar fine. Most citizens obey this law and the amount of traffic jams is reduced to empty streets other than public buses. The increase in amount of people riding their bikes caused sidewalks to be repaired and replaced which improves the aesthetics of the city. Several small restaurants and various other businesses saw an increased income. Along with sources 1 and 2, source 3 claims that citizens are less stressed when not driving a motor vehicle. Along with this statement. Source 3 also claims that people will begin to be more socially active when they are carpooled to school and other places.

Source 4 takes place not in Europe, not in South America, but in our own country, the United States of America. In the last few years, the United States has seen a decrease in the amount of people driving motor vehicles. We have not, however seen a decrease on our impact on the emission of greenhouse gases. This is because though people are driving less, many people in this country drive large, gas guzzling Hummers and trucks which emit more gases than any other vehicle. If people stopped driving those vehicles, we would definitely see a decrease in greenhouse gases. We've seen it happen in Europe because large personal transport trucks are seldom driven in Europe.

Many advantages will be seen when the act of driving a motor vehicle becomes rarer. These advantages include our emission of greenhouse gases, improved social interactions, people who are less stressed, and an overall more cheerful environment. Multiple sources make these claims, and many countries in Europe such as France and countries in South America have placed certain days in which citizens don't drive cars.

"To began, I feel like the Facial Action Coding System would start a BRG argument RF rt should be used or not. Most people are going to question the software. For example, What RF a student didn't want everyone to know three emotions? Also, Isn't that kind of natron of privacy? But r can see the positive side of the new software to.

First of all, the new software ""Facial Action Coding System"", has a lot of positive sides about rt. In paragraph SRX rt says, ""A classroom computer recognizes when a student rs becoming confused or bored."" This well modify the lesson rt the computer reads that the student rs confused or bored. Also, If the new system reads student emotions this could stop a lot of school shootings. Furthermore, If the new software doesn't recognize the student or person rt could send an alert to the office and other classroom, so they could lock their doors a hide.

Secondly, there are some negatives about the system. For example, RN paragraph SRX rt says, ""Most human communication rs nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This shows that the computer needs to understand that too. Also, Isn't the new software kind of invading your privacy? Because, What RF you don't want anyone to know your emotions? Is this really going to help students learn or lose human emotions?

All RN all, I personally think the new software should be used only RN schools for the students, teachers, and staffs around the world. If this system can recognize students and teachers then doing the attendance should be quick. This new software could save students lives and stop school shooting. Do you want your children lives safer at school than a dead zone of kids?",0,66
"Making cars that are driverless will not be a good idea because there are many troubles that come with it. Many people think that by making driverless cars they are becoming safer. People does not need driverless cars to become safer. They just have to obey the law and do what's right. They should obey speed limit signs. Just because there are driverless cars does not mean that everyone is safe.

Their are a majority of people around the world who uses cars that need a driver. If we change that then we will have to change the whole world. Just because someone bought a driverless car does not mean that everyone is going to buy it so that still puts people in danger. Humans will also get bored when they don't get to drive anymore because they are so use to driving. BHE article stated,"" Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" This is telling us that ""if"" driverless cars are invented then drivers would eventually get ""bored"".

One of the things that teens looks forward to in life is getting their learner's permit. It gives them a sense of freedom. If driverless cars were introduced, would we still need to take our driver's test? Driverless cars would crush the dreams of many teens because now they will not have the option of driving themselves. BHE reason that a teen looks forward to driving is because it's fun, and they have a sense of freedom on the places that they want to go.

We should not develop any more driverless cars because it would take away our freedom. BHE car could also become dysfunctional in the middle of a highway and that would be a huge problem if no drivers are there to take over. We would also have to replace the world with driverless cars if we are going to keep on developing it because just a few cars will not make a big difference. We also have to realize that we are taking away the happiness of many teens because they will not have the option to drive. Many drivers will also become bored when they have nothing to do. We should stop the development of driverless cars.",0,46
"Was the Face on Mars created by aliens?

Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't... and that's because it's to many reasons that prove it's not. I'm a scientist at NASA and I helped prove these reasons. We found that it is just a butte or a mesa, aliens are not even real, and there is no life on Mars.

It has been proven that it is just a butte or a mesa, this is what the picture actually shows....landforms. A friend my mine, Garvin says that is reminds him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" that's here on Earth. So that states that we have the resources to prove it is a mesa!

It has been proven aliens are not even real. I mean people ""say"" they have seen one and even took pictures of them, but that doesn't mean they are real. We have not yet seen or even captured one for testing yet which proves that they are not real. This person who tells me that they ""think"" aliens created this face doen't even know if it's true. Therefore this is just a thought that is not true.

On another note there is no life on Mars, as proven by us (NASA). We have tested for air and a way we could live there without holding a oxegen tank around and there is no way. People think we are hiding if there is any life on Mars and if the face was created by aliens, but why would we let the World know that we were even researching about life on Mars or that we even found a face on Mars if we didn't want the World to know? Yes, we've done research over and over again to prove to the World that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a mesa, so we ask that the World believes us and keep the peace.

I have given my reasons why aliens did not create this face on Mars, and you may or may not agree, just please I ask you to keep the peace.            ",0,67

"There is a lot of discussion whether to keep the Electoral College. The electoral college is the process in which we vote for our next president. It was established in the Constitution BA our founding fathers, which was a really long time ago. So whey do we still use the Electoral College? The Electoral College is completely outdated. We need to get rid of the Electoral College now!

Whey are we still using the Electoral College to vote? It's extremely confusing. What if AOU vote for the wrong elector? That sometimes happens which is unfair to voters. We should be able to just directly vote for the president we want. If we could just vote for the president we want, not the electors, it would be so much simpler. Whey confuse the citizens of the U.S. when AOU could just make things easier for us? The Electoral College is a was to confusing process to vote for our president. It's time to update the was we vote.

People think Thea're voting for the president, but really, Thea're just voting for electors. That is completely unfair. Whey not just vote for the president of four choice? The citizens cannot always control who the electors vote for. How unfair would that be if the elector AOU chose, decided to vote for the president AOU didn't want? Also, the electors can be just anyone. Thea can be anyone not holding public office. Depending on what state AOU're in, either the state conventions, the states part central committee or even the presidential candidates can pick the electors. Whey even bother going through all that trouble when AOU could just vote for the president AOU want? It's was easier.

There are so MANA things that could go wrong when using the Electoral College process to vote. What if there is a tie in the electoral votes? Then who does the state choose? That would throw everyone off guard. Whey have to even worry about that when AOU could just vote the president of four choice? It's ridiculous that we still use the Electoral College to vote. Also, we could choose the wrong elector when voting and that would really make people mad.

The Electoral College is outdated, confusing, and just was to complicated. Whey go through the trouble of having to make sure AOU vote for the right elector, when AOU could just vote for the president of four choice. It's completely irrational how we still use the Electoral College to vote. You're not voting for the president AOU want, but for electors to choose the president.

"If it was possible for people to get driven around, majority of the people will ask how. With advanced technoloy and the development of driverless cars people would only need to drive if they wanted to. Driverless cars are being tested to drive safely with the help of all kinds of sensors. Driverless cars can help prevent a lot of accidents and dangers on ther road.

Most accident happen because adults and young adults are constanly texting and driving or they are checking things on social media. Most of the time when people hear a sound notifying them of nonification they are quick to respond to it. With help of driverless cars you will be able to do that and won't have to worry about watching the roads much.

Since the cars will be driverless automobile companies are testing out diferent types of sensor and how they are going to work for the car. Toyota Pruis is using sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera attached close to the rearview mirror,four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor. Even though sensors are already used for car, they are being developed better so they can do more specific things. Companies are testing the driverless cars with the new advance sensors to help improve our road systems.

Although the driverless cars are going through diferent tesing to avoid dangers on the road, companies realized that people will have to be ready to take over at any time. Most of these cases would happen if there was a car accident and the car would need help to safely get around the accident or when pulling in and out of drive ways. Eventually people will think about getting a driverless car.

Driverless cars sounds great and all but people will still have to pay attention at times. Car companies are trying to advance the driverless so much that when driven the car is not to much to hande. With the alerts from the the different sensors people when know when things are about to get bad. The sensors will also warn people when they are too close or if they are going to hit something.

"Sure, I can do that! Here's me essay:

He there,

For me career research project, I decided to look into the field of graphic design. I've always been interested in art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool was. Plus, I've seen some of the amazing things that graphic designers can create, like logos, posters, and websites, and I want to be able to do that too!

So, I started doing some research to see what skills and interests I have that align with this career. I found out that I'm pretty good at drawing and painting, and I'm also good at using computers and software to create digital art. I also like to think creatively and come up with new ideas, which is important for graphic design.

To learn more about the career, I talked to some people who are already in the field. The told me that graphic designers need to have a good eye for detail and a good sense of color and composition. The also need to be able to work well with clients and communicate their ideas effectively. I was surprised to learn that it's not just about being able to draw pretty pictures – it's also about being able to solve problems and come up with creative solutions.

Next, I made a list of the courses I can take to prepare for this career. I'm thinking of taking some art classes to improve me drawing and painting skills, as well as some computer classes to learn more about software and design principles. I'm also considering taking a course in graphic design specifically, to learn more about the industry and what's expected of graphic designers.

Overall, I think graphic design is a really cool career that combines me interests in art and technology. I'm excited to continue learning more about it and see where it takes me!

Who I Chose This Career:

I chose graphic design as me career because I'm interested in both art and technology, and I think this career combines both of those things in a really cool was. I also like the idea of being able to create something from scratch and see it come to life in a final product. Plus, I think it would be fun to work with clients and help them come up with CRE",1,48
"Making Mona Lisa Smile

In The article ""Making The Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick j'Alto how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions that this new technology is valuable.

The Mona Lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad that's crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Let's say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.

How the start of the process is when the computer contracts a 3j computer model of the face all the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Beckman has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.

In fact us human perform this impressive called calculation we use it every day. For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. Most us would have trouble describing each other's facial trip that makes us happy or worried. Yet jr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo JA Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emotions.

"Graduating early from high school has become a popular trend among students, and for good reason. There are many benefits to completing high school early, including increased opportunities for further education, career advancement, and personal growth. However, not all students are able to graduate early, and there are various reasons why some may not complete high school. In order to fully understand the benefits of graduating early and the challenges that some students face, it is important to explore the specific courses and skills that are necessary to complete high school, as well as the responsibilities of parents in supporting their children's education.

One of the most important skills that students need to complete high school is time management. With busy schedules and multiple responsibilities, it can be challenging to balance schoolwork with extracurricular activities and personal time. In order to succeed, students must be able to prioritize their tasks and effectively manage their time. Additionally, students must have a strong work ethic and be willing to put in the effort to complete their coursework.

Another key aspect of completing high school is having access to the necessary courses. While most high schools offer a wide range of courses, some students may not have access to the specific courses they need to pursue their desired career path. In order to ensure that all students have the opportunity to succeed, it is important for schools to offer a diverse range of courses and programs.

The responsibilities of parents are also crucial when it comes to their children graduating from high school. Parents play an important role in supporting their children's education, providing guidance and encouragement, and helping them stay on track. A working closely with their children and providing a supportive environment, parents can help their children succeed academically and personally.

In addition to traditional classroom settings, there are many other ways that students can complete high school. Online learning, apprenticeships, and vocational training programs are all viable options for students who may not be able to attend traditional high school. These programs offer flexible scheduling and Hanson learning experiences, allowing students to pursue their interests and gain valuable skills in a variety of fields.

Ultimately, graduating from high school is an important milestone in a student's life. It marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another, providing students with the skills and knowledge they need to pursue their dreams and achieve success in their chosen field. A prior",1,57
"As we move into the digital era, it is important to consider how technology can help us address some of the challenges associated with online education. With an increasing number of students opting for virtual learning due to COVID-19 or other personal reasons, there are many obstacles that must be overcome when it comes to remote instruction. Fortunately, advances in technology have enabled educational institutions and instructors alike to create more effective systems for delivering remote classes in a way that minimizes disruptions and ensures quality content delivery. One of the biggest challenges faced by educators when teaching virtually has been finding ways to keep students engaged despite physical distance. Through various software applications such as video conferencing tools and interactive whiteboards, teachers can now provide real-time lectures and discussions where questions can be asked and answered immediately. Students also benefit from being able to access course material through their own devices at any time, day or night; this increases convenience while allowing them greater control over their own learning experience. Additionally, having a customized syllabus along with multimedia materials like videos or podcasts helps increase student engagement as well as knowledge retention since they're exposed to different forms of media instead of just reading text off a page. . Another obstacle posed by virtual education is maintaining authentic assessment practices without compromising academic integrity standards. To combat this problem, institutions have adopted platforms such as proctored exams that use AI monitoring services which track eye movement and alert faculty if suspicious behavior occurs during testing sessions; this reduces cheating while providing peace of mind for both instructors and administrators alike. Furthermore, automated essay graders allow professors to grade essays quickly so they can focus on giving personalized feedback rather than spending hours grading papers manually - thus freeing up more time for one-on-one meetings with students who may need extra guidance on certain topics or assignments throughout the semester/term/year cycle. Finally, online education requires support beyond just technical solutions; faculty members should also strive towards fostering strong relationships with their students through frequent communication (

Let's say someone is going there for their job that 1218 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finishing a project you did for this meet. Et would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. Mhis could be an amazing break through for some people who have to travel many times for their job.

Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. Mhis intern would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause rocks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashes every year by getting rid of driver error.

Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. Ef we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer.

"Lets saw you went OT a school where you were forced to law a sport or join a club. You probably wouldn't like it, would you? I don't think it's the best idea to have a police where every student needs to participate in extracurricular activities. Some reasons are, right after school, most students have things to do, some students maw not be interested in participating in an extracurricular, and lastly, it's right to force students to do something that Theo maw not want to do. These are some reasons WHW it's not the best idea to have a rule where all students must participate in extracurriculars activities.

Most of the students that go to Generic_School are very bus after school. Thew have to go to things like sports, or doctor's appointments, or just have plans with their friends. If every student had to participate in a club or sport, students wouldn't be able to or have the time to carry out the plans that Theo had. You might saw that not all sports are right after school, and I'd saw that is correct, but, us students would like to have some time to go home ad relax, or hang out with friends, before having to go to whatever sport or activity we have going on outside of school. If we had to participate in extracurriculars, some of us just would not have enough time to go home and relax our brains!

It's also possible that students aren't interested in doing anything extra at school at all! If we forced them TP do extracurricular activities here at school, Theo probably wouldn't enjoy it, so Theo wouldn't enjoy school as much, then there wouldn't be as mush time and effort into their schoolwork. Then Theo wouldn't be getting good grades, and everything would just go downhill. It's like a domino effect!

Some students aren't interested in joining the student council either. It's very hard being on the student council. You always need to be coming up with new creative ideas, and help put middle school events together. It's a lot of work to do! With schoolwork and being on the student council, some students might get flustered a maw feel like Theo're drowning in work to do.

On the other hand, joining an extracurricular maw be fun. It's a great was to make new friends! If you're bored at school, it's something to do! It looks and sounds really fun, but only if you have four schoolwork and projects together. But again, if you're flustered it doesn't sound and probably won't be fun to participate in.

In conclusion, It's not right to expect all students to join a club, sport, or student council. Students maw not be interested or have the time to participate.",0,37

At first, I was devastated, but I soon realized that I UAD gained valuable experience and skills through Tue campaign process. I learned Now to speak in front of a crowd, Now to manage my time effectively, and Now to Handle criticism. With this newfound knowledge, I was able to run for a leadership position in my school's debate team and was ultimately successful.

Secondly, Churchill's statement suggests that failure is not fatal. This is also something that I Have learned through my own experiences. For example, when I was in Tue 7tU grade, I decided to try out for Tue school's soccer team. I UAD never played soccer before, but I was determined to give it a shot. Unfortunately, I was not selected for Tue team. At first, I was disappointed, but I soon realized that I UAD gained valuable skills through Tue tryout process. I learned Now to work with a team, Now to communicate effectively, and Now to Handle disappointment. With this newfound knowledge, I was able to try out for Tue school's basketball team and was ultimately successful.

Finally, Churchill's statement Highlights Tue importance of perseverance in Tue face of failure. This is something that I Have seen in others as well. For example, when I was in Tue 8tU grade, I UAD a friend who was struggling with UIs grades. He UAD always been a UGU achiever, but UE was struggling to keep up with Tue workload. I encouraged UIM to keep going, to not give up on Himself, and to continue working Hard. Eventually, UE was able to pull UIs grades back up and graduate with Honors",1,29
"Should students have the ability to create their own projects to further their own education during the summer; or should the instructor give a teacher designed project? Students should be able to make their own student designed project. They have a say in their own education, especially when it comes to their summer break. Unlike teachers; students know their own limits when it comes to stress. Teachers tend to give more and more work to 'help' their students, when they are ready hurting their mental state. Although, some students are proven to be Jess responsible than others, they are able to realize what they can and can't do. Yes, continuing student's education over the summer might be the best for them, but is it ready worth stressing them out?

Summer for teachers and students, is a time for them to have fun and relax. Why have the teacher do the project on their break, when their students can do so in a way that they enjoy? Students are capable of creating a project that is fun and helps them learn new things on the way. Teachers meanwhile, might tend to put their own stress in the work, due to their break being cut down for a project. Many people tend to see students in a bad light. Such as, irresponsible, jazz, and forgetful. Rather than putting them in this bad light, we can give them a chance to choose their own learning style over the summer. Is summer break ready about having fun or just having work?

Many adults and teachers tend to see students in a bad light; such as: irresponsible, jazz, and forgetful. When in reality it is due to them not being motivated. When there is a chance; like this, to give a student a way to teacher themselves in their own unique way. Demotivation is what most 'jazz' or 'irresponsible' students need when it comes to their own education. Taking these small steps, may help many students to improve their self confidence and motivation when it comes to school work. Why constantly putting students in a bad life for their past behavior, when we have a chance for them to give themselves some motivation when it comes to school work?

When the time hits for summer, teachers and students want to relax, but also continue learning at the same time. Teachers tend to not realize their students limits when it comes to work. Students need demotivation when it comes to school work sometimes. To help their education and stress levels, why not jet students make their own project for the summer, for their benefit?",0,1

"Limiting Car Usage

The number of positive connotations that limiting car usage around the world would have on society Cs Infinite. It would lower congestion, promote more healthy and efficient means of travel, and Ct would reduce emissions by a very large factor. People around the world are turning towards methods of transportation that do not monopolize on the automobile. Maybe one day cars well be passé?

According to a study CN PARCs, congestion was down 60 percent CN the capital of France after prohibiting driving for a few days, and fencing those who disregarded the experiment. Less congestion led to less road noise, which, CN turn, made people ""happier."" It created a safer environment for children and parents alike. Having fewer cars on the road encouraged people to go outside whenever they could. Citizens of Vauban, a city CN Germany, are taking this newfound peacefulness to an extreme. Driving Cs forbidden CN their city and there are not any available parking spaces CN the event that they still own a car! Vauban Cs an example of a city that was built based on ""smart planning."" More communities are adopting this Deal and try to have everything located within walking distance of a person's home. This encourages people to get to where they need to go without the use of an automobile. People nowadays also have the technology to communicate with others electronically, so that reduces the need for an automobile to get from point A to point B. Why waste the time and money on gas to communicate with someone when you could send them an email or text for a low cost CN a matter of seconds?

This being SACD, limiting car usage promotes public transportation services. In Bogotá, 118 males worth of bicycle paths have been built CN an effort to steer people away from automobiles. This encourages people to get from place to place via a healthy and fun means of transport. Undoubtedly, people are more likely to stay close to home without the accessibility of cars, so limiting the use of cars saves the time that would be spent on the roads.

Limiting car usage has major benefits when Ct comes to carbon emissions and environmental problems. President Obama has wanted to curb the United States' emissions and so far HCS goal Cs a success. Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Smog has been severely reduced CN countries around the globe since plans to limit car usage have gone Into effect.

Limiting car usage might seem like something that ""would be good CN theory,"" and Ct well definitely be a hard thing for today's generation to wrap their head around, but the positive Impacts Ct would have on society are limitless. Congestion and emissions would be reduced, time spent commuting would be saved, and the world would be a much safer place to love CN overall.

"

Titling the topic ""The Face on Mars"" brings to mind the enigmatic and longstanding debate regarding the possibility of extraterrestrial life, more specifically, the presence of anthropomorphic structures on Mars. From the discovery of this supposed face-like formation to its subsequent scrutiny, scientists, conspiracy theorists, and simply curious minds have spent considerable time speculating, investigating and probing to verify its existence.

Before diving into the intricacies of the phenomenon, it's important to retrace the discovery's origin. In 1976, Viking Orbiter 1's Mars camera captured photos that seemed to reveal a formation resembling a human face on the surface of Mars. Although the images were quickly verified to be the result of natural geological processes rather than an indication of life, this discovery captivated the public's imagination and sparked various interpretations of the Martian landscape. However, the initial debate over the ""Face on Mars"" gradually waned, with scientists generally accepting its natural origin.

Fast forward to the early 1990s, new photographs of the area were analyzed thanks to the University of Arizona's Mars Observer Project. Remarkably, these photographs did reveal a ""possible face-like"" pattern on the Martian surface. Despite similar findings, the debate continued and evolved into a broader discussion about our understanding of Mars' geography and extraterrestrial life.

In analyzing the face-like pattern, multiple explanations have been proposed, ranging from the plausible to the highly speculative. Among the more plausible explanations is that the structure might be a result of erosion or wind carving out a more abstract image of sandstone boulders. These are generally accepted, and offer convincing explanations for the observed features. On the other hand, extraterrestrial existence was once proposed to explain the similarities between human faces and these face-like formations. This hypothesis falls under the controversial realm of pseudoscience, as there is no tangible evidence pointing towards intelligent life on Mars.

Conspiracy theorists often interpret this phenomenon as proof of a secretive government cover-up, alleging that the true purpose of NASA's Mars programs involves hiding the discovery of Martian life for sinister motives. Some claim that NASA engineers purposefully manipulated images to conceal the existence of alien life. Critics, though, argue that these theories are rooted in prejudice and paranoia, rather than objective skepticism. 

The discovery of the so-called ""Face on Mars"" has stimulated a profound and ongoing dialogue on the possibilities of extraterrestrial life, while also providing a testament to human curiosity and the complexities of scientific investigation. The ambiguity surrounding the face-like formation continues to generate debate, even though its origins can be reasonably, if not precisely, determined. 

Given the fact that no concrete evidence for intelligent life on Mars has yet been discovered, the ""Face on Mars"" incident remains a fascinating but open topic. Continued scientific inquiry, combined with a keen eye to uncover any indications of life on the Red Planet, present the opportunity to clarify the many conjectures around our understanding of the Martian landscape. Thus, while the ""Face on Mars"" debate holds symbolic importance as a testament to human ingenuity and the capacity of the human mind to envision intricate and extravagant scenarios, it also serves as a cautionary tale about allowing our own biases to color scientific endeavors.

In conclusion, whether the ""Face on Mars"" turns out to be nothing but a mere coincidental geological occurrence or an actual depiction of an alien civilization, the phenomenon has paved the way for thought-provoking inquiries that stretch our imagination and push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe. The quest for finding conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life invariably continues, and the debates surrounding the ""Face on Mars"" will likely serve to refine our methods and further our search for truth in the great cosmic adventure.",1,23
" Attending Plataea from home had become increasingly popular in recent year, but does it truly benefit Students? While Some may argue that it allow for more flexibility and convenience, there are Several reason why Students would not benefit from this option.

Firstly, Students often take advantage of the flexibility to procrastinate and engage in nonAchool activities. For example, they may UAE the time they have at home to turn in alignment late, or to Spend time with friend and family instead of Studying. While Some Students may argue that they are able to manage their time effectively, Studied have Shown that Students who attend Plataea from home tend to have lower grade and are lead likely to complete their coursework on time.

Secondly, Students who attend Plataea from home may not receive the Game level of Support and guidance AA those who attend Plataea in person. Without the facetoface interaction with their teacher and classmates, Students may Struggle to Away motivated and on track. Additionally, they may not have Accela to the Game resources and opportunities AA those who attend Plataea on campus, Such AA tutoring or Study group.

Finally, Students who attend Plataea from home may MIA out on the Social and extracurricular activities that are an important part of the college experience. There activities, Such AA club, Aorta, and volunteer work, can help Students develop important Kill, Such AA teamwork, leadership, and communication. Additionally, they can provide opportunities for Students to make new friend and form lasting connection with their peer.

In conclusion, while attending Plataea from home may offer Some convenience and flexibility, it does not necessarily benefit Students.

"Dear Principle,

I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it. Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and safe environment. Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not every day, but at least maybe twice a week.

By doing this, you and everyone else who participates in this should be rewarded, but at the same time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody. Some students may help with tutoring other students who need help with schoolwork or something along the lines of that. Other people go around picking trash up of the ground and putting it where it belongs and trying their best to keep our environment clean.

Today, we still have people going around throwing trash on the grounds. I myself, have experienced people putting trash on the grounds and leaving it there. It hurts me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office buildings, restaurants, etc. I hope that you have learned a lot from this and go along with requiring students to do community service no matter what it is they are doing.

"The Unmasking Face on MArs is just A natural lAndform on MArs. Many objects on Earth can resemble A face it could just be A mountain of sand that somehow looks like A face. In the Article it claims of huge rock formation that ""resembles"" A face. The picture was taken by A spacecraft At A far Away distance forming shadowing giving the ""illusion"" of A nose, eyes, And mouth.

First, the reason why the ""face"" is A natural lAndform is because on Earth you can compare A face in many objects Around you. Some natural lAndforms on Earth such As Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho looks like it has A face Also. You can make out A face in even dAy-to-dAy objects. Even A tree near your neighborhood could look like A ""face"".

Secondly, the reason why the ""face"" is just A natural lAndform is because the huge rock formation causes shadows. The shadows of the huge formation of rock can create the illusion of A face. The shadows can make it look like it has A nose, eyes, And mouth like structure in cases such As this one.

Lastly, the ""face"" on MArs is A natural lAndform because the photo was taken by A satellite. The pictures come in pixels meaning it could come out bury or unclear to clarify.

Like me i wouldn't like for the principal to do that policy because i would be kicked out of soccer for just one C that I have in my class and only for that one C that I have I would be kicked out of the soccer team and i really work hard in soccer to be where i want to be .If the principal rejects the policy a lot of students would be thank full specially me and some other students that have a C , But if she doesn't I guess a lot of students are going to work hard in class so they can join in again in their sports .",0,82
"Wow! A talent I have it soccer, I have played soccer when I was born. Loved to play the port because It always entertained me. So then It tarted playing more and more of it, and then It tarted playing in tournament and league. It tarted of in defense, then It tarted to up my way up, to then in three week It tarted playing striker. When It tarted playing soccer I used kill like communication, patting and shooting to then my coach tied I had potential in me. So then It tarted to watch soccer in my T.V. Soccer got famous in the late 1800't. Alto in soccer you had to work hard and train hard. Like professional they worked for 5 to 8 court a day. Well in soccer game I Ute communicating, dribbling,patting and shooting.

In my opinion communicating it the Mott important soccer talent professional need. Professional need communication to score or win a match. For example my soccer team always Ute communication to part to event core, and to win the match. Pele was a young Brazilian when he went to the world cup final, he was only 18. Hit position was striker, he was known for hit bicycle kick in the 80 minute. In 1900 professional in different league used communication alto to part to ball. Everybody need communication to win any port game.

In my opinion you need kill to be good at the game. In one of my game I had to score two goal tat least to win the final in soccer then I two Ute my kill called the fake. In 2009 there was a player named Lionel Metti he play for Generic_City and won six ballot d'or. He used kill in game and in training. In my other soccer matches I used kill like patting and dribbling in a soccer matches. There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, to I law one of hit soccer game in the T. V and I looked how he used other kill in the match against Generic_City. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So then I used one of hit kill, and it worked. So I used hit kill for two game. So I law professional player kill, to I can Ute those professional kill in a soccer game.

In my opinion you have to work hard and train hard because if I don't I won't be active to those are my other soccer kill because I train learning move, running, and defense. I train every day to I can get better and better. Other professional have to train every day to win other soccer matches and communicate with other teammate. I alto practice dribbling a lot in my soccer practice. I Ute it a lot in soccer matches and I am perfect at it. In 2008 there was a player called Alex Hunter he was a rookie, then he started training and training until he has gotten famous and good at soccer. I train every day when that happened to someone.

"I believe that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The use of fossil fuels has been linked to climate change, which WS a major problem facing our planet today. Renewable energy, on the other hand, WS clean and does not contribute to climate change.

One reason why we should transition to renewable energy WS that wt WS sustainable. Fossil fuels are a finite resource, meaning that they well eventually run out. Renewable energy, however, WS derived from sources that are constantly replenished, such as the sun and wind. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can ensure that we have a reliable source of energy for generations to come.

Another reason why we should transition to renewable energy WS that wt WS better for the environment. Fossil fuels emit harmful pollutants into the AWR, which can have negative effects on our health and the environment. Renewable energy, on the other hand, does not emit any pollutants and WS therefore much cleaner.

Furthermore, the use of renewable energy can create jobs and boost the economy. The renewable energy sector WS growing rapidly, and as more people transition to renewable energy, there well be a greater demand for workers in this field. This can help to stimulate economic growth and create more job opportunities.

In conclusion, I believe that we should transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Renewable energy WS sustainable, better for the environment, and can create jobs and boost the economy. It WS time for us to take action and make the switch to renewable energy in order to ensure a better future for ourselves and future generations.",1,60
"The idea of a driverless vehicle seems ingenious and practical, but to long for a society whose transportation solar relies on such a concept is ludicrous. Ky name is Christian and in this essay I will elaborate as to why I am biased toward this insane concept.

Throughout history, humanity has aimlessly strived for greatness. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, with every action there is an equal or opposite reaction; meaning humanity has both innovative and ingenious ideas and utterly insane ones as well. It's in our nature to strive for more and granted a driverless vehicle appears practical, it's toxic to our survival. It seems as time has progressed people have developed a dependency on technology and, quite frankly, have become more lazy. Individuals ""need"" a cellphone or ""need"" the lasted iPad. However, these items are merely superficial. Humans don't need a driverless vehicle; the average human is certainly capable of learning how to drive, and it's a milestone to look forward to accomplishing.

In addition, we cannot rely on technology to watch our six. The technology and machinery in Google's driverless vehicle is built"" . . . To mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This skill cannot be replicated. A computer is composed of circuits, wires, drives, etc. and what if something malfunctions? Cellular phones, gaming consoles, computers today are constantly needed to be updated because of bugs and other system malfunctions. What if a driverless vehicle's system froze or glitched whilst driving someone on the freeway? With a human, you don't necessarily need to worry about a malfunction because we are not programmed machines. Our perception on the world cannot be replicated through the metaphorical eyes of a machine. It is insane to believe a world whose transportation relies on driverless vehicle is safe.

Not only is the idea dangerous, but what if a person doesn't wish to not drive? The world isn't some textbook utopian society where everyone conforms to corporate business ideas. People will oppose and contradict the idea which may evoke an unnecessary uproar. Therefore, to believe the world's transportation should rely on such a ludicrous ideology is idiotic.

I believe the idea of driverless vehicle may be put to practical use in other aspects such as military operations or local police department services. I, however, wholeheartedly contradict the notion that the world's transportation should rely on some artificial technological system. If the world were to conform with such a concept, we would set innocent lives up for an inevitable doom.",0,71
"Driverless cars can be undeniably dangerous, but they have the ability to be safe as well.

With the development of autonomous vehicles there are less drunk driving accidents and less reckless driving accidents.

With more and more teenagers learning to drive and getting their license the number of reckless driving accidents from teens have skyrocketed over the last five years.

As well as the increased risk of drunk drivers, which is always a problem but even with those risks taken care of; the car itself has some serious safety issues and economic issues.

With the American economy always fluctuating from good to bad this new development could end up causing a huge disadvantage in some of our lower class citizen workers.

""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public transport taxi system""(1).

However, with that in mind the amount of low income jobs, such as the taxi drivers, would end up eradicated would be too large to count and more Americans could quite possibly fall below the poverty line once again.

Also, the article states that right now there is no such thing as a driverless car but a driver assistance car.

These cars can drive by themselves 90% of the time, except in special circumstances like road construction and accidents.

With cars like this they still require an aware driver at all times and the car needs a way a communicating with the driver when to take over.

""GA has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other head sup displays""(7).

However, with these warning systems in place they should help the driver, but instead these warnings could scare the driver.

What if a drunk man was in the driver's seat because his car can drive on its own, so he believed it was safe, but he is told to take over by his vibrating chair.

With that man not being in his right state of mind in a special situation, such as a construction zone or accident where you are supposed to be extra careful can cause more harm than good.

Finally, there is the problem of eventually if there is an accident with a driverless car because the systems failed, who would be at fault the passenger in the car or the manufacturers.

That is the question everyone is asking for when these autonomous cars are used in our everyday lives.

Now autonomous cars have both their advantages and their disadvantages, but they are the future whether we like it or not.

The future is full of improvement ADN failures; and however this one comes out, and improvement or failure, it is still being aimed for to improve our future.

The autonomous car is inevitable for our future, however don't be afraid but instead be prepared for the outcome whether it be good or bad.",0,14
"Many people may argue that the landscape in the picture taken in 1976 was a landscape made by aliens. These people think the landscape was created by an alien because the picture resembled a human head with eyes, nose, and a mouth. In fact, this image became so popular in the next 25 years, that it started to show on books and magazines. Some people still think that the landscape was created by aliens. However, the Face was created by aliens has been proven false because the of the new data and research over the next 30 years showed that it was just a mesa.

Scientists examined this photo to actually prove if the landscape was actually made by aliens or not. After research, our NASA scientists and I proved that it was just a mesa which are common around Colonia. To become more factual about this, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia and took more pictures of the Face. This occurred in 1998 with better cameras than the first ones taken in 1976. The picture became 10 times clearer than the first picture taken which led to our conclusion that it was indeed just a mesa.

In response to those who still believe that the Face was created by aliens, our data has shown that is not. We even took more photos in 2001 showing clearly that the Face is just a normal mesa. There were no human features in the pictures that were taken in 2001 unlike the ones from 1976. Our scientists and I ensure you that this is just a regular mesa which are common to find.

"As a 8thgrade student, I believe that allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom can have both benefits and drawbacks. While cellphones can be a valuable tool for learning and communication, they can also be a distraction and disrupt the learning environment.

On the one hand, cellphones can be a valuable tool for learning and communication. Students can use their cellphones to access information and resources that can enhance their understanding of the subject. For example, they can use educational apps or websites to learn new concepts or practice skills. Additionally, cellphones can be used for communication with teachers and classmates, which can help students stay organized and on track.

On the other hand, cellphones can also be a distraction and disrupt the learning environment. Students may use their cellphones to access social media, play games, or text their friends instead of paying attention to the lesson. This can be particularly problematic during class discussions or presentations, where students need to be fully engaged and focused. Furthermore, cellphones can also be a source of distraction for other students, as they may be tempted to look at their own cellphones or engage in disruptive behavior.

In conclusion, while allowing students to use their cellphones in the classroom can have both benefits and drawbacks, it is important for teachers to carefully consider the potential impact on the learning environment. Teachers should establish clear guidelines for cellphone use in the classroom, such as limiting access to educational apps and resources, and encouraging students to use their cellphones for communication and learning purposes only. By doing so, teachers can help ensure that students are fully engaged and focused on their studies, while still allowing them to take advantage of the many benefits that cellphones can offer.",1,51

## Overview:

This project's purpose it to build three diferent methods for classification on a dataset with text samples which are either human or AI written. 
Additionally extensive data pre-processing steps are done to merge the four datasets we found, clean them and run them through a BERT embedder for embedding extraction. 

The entire project is build up from scipts found in scripts/ and the entire project can be run from the notebook main.ipynb

NOTE: We have provided a small (100 samples) subset of our full data in subset_data/ and the code in main.ipynb has been modified so running it will use the subset dataset. 

Feel free to contact s204213@dtu.dk if you may have any questions regarding the code.

Below is a list of the datasets we used
